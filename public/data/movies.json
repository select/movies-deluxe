This film is also known as \"The Gill Women\" and \"The Gill Women of Venus\". This film began life as a Soviet-produced work. An American producer then added some new footage and changed the credits to hide the film's Soviet origin. The original film, \"Planeta Bur\", is also known as \"Cosmonauts on Venus\", \"Planet of Storms\", \"Planet of Tempests\", \"Planeta Burg\", and \"Storm Planet\". Much of the film \"Planeta Bur\" was also incorporated into the \"American\" film \"Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet\" . This film was shown in \"Pathe\" color, which is essentially just a method of placing color filters over a black and white film. Consequently, the color that you see is not the true color of the sets but instead represents an \"interpretation\" of a black and white original. This film can be downloaded as a Theora file. The file size is approximately 25% larger than the MPEG-2, with similar quality. Simply click on this link . You can find more information regarding this film on its IMDb page . More information is also available from the Wikipedia article here ."

        "description": "This is the most complete version available (just over 93 minutes) as this movie was demanded by Bram Stokers widow to be destroyed after winning 2 lawsuits in the mid & late 1920's. Tinted scenes and beautiful quality. I have seen the current version here at archive.org and decided to post this one as it is of much better video quality, although the music is a nit hokey. Enjoy this classic horror with the very creepy Max Schrek as the (IMHO) best vampire ever to waltz across the silver screen. (IMDB.COM Description) An unauthorized production of Bram Stoker's work (The legal heirs didn't give their permission), so the names had to be changed. But this wasn't enough: The widow of Bram Stoker won two lawsuits (1924 and 1929) in which she demanded the destruction of all copies of the movie, however happily copies of it were already too widespread to destroy them all. Later, Universal studios could break her resistance against this movie. Count Orlok's move to Wisburg (Obviously the real \"Wismar\") brings the plague traceable to his dealings with the Realtor Thomas Hutter, and the Count's obsession with Hutter's wife, Ellen the only one with the power to end the evil. DVD Empire Description A Symphony Of Horror A long time ago in middle Europe, a decrepit, forbidding castle stood... Casting an ominous shadow over the townspeople who dare not look upon it, the unholy dwelling is home to one Count Orlok (Max Schreck) , an undead night creature with a taste for human blood. Into this picture steps Hutter, an unwary traveler who visits the Count. He carries with him the deed for a property Orlock wishes to buy in Hutter's home town of Wisborg. That night, in preparation for the long sea voyage ahead, the vampire hastily loads his coffin aboard ship and waits... Once at sea, Orlock bares his fangs and upon arrival in Wisborg, leaves behind a floating morgue. Now, preparing to feast on the citizens, the cadaveous Count, prowls the darkness as the eerie Nosferatu."

        "description": "Sergei Eisenstein shot ¡Que viva México! in Mexico in 1931 at the height of the Great Depression. The courageous financiers of this project were the author Upton Sinclair, his wife Mary Craig and a small group of their friends. They had great difficulties in keeping the production going; the economic crisis forced Sinclair to call a halt to it in early 1932. Shooting was stopped with most of the work completed; only one episode could not be filmed. At the same time Josef Stalin insisted on Eisenstein's return to the Soviet Union. Eisenstein left Mexico with Sinclair's promise in mind; that all the negatives would be send to him to enable the final editing of the film in Moscow. Sinclair tried several times in vain to transfer the film footage to Russia, but the Soviet Film Industry was instructed not to import the film. Eisenstein had been denounced both as a political renegade and as a Trotskyite, which was, in the eyes of Stalin, a serious offence. Preventing Eisenstein from finishing his Mexican film was Stalin's punishment. Consequently Eisenstein was left without film work for several years and started teaching at the State Film School. The Stalinist propaganda, which heaped all the blame on Upton Sinclair for the tragic end of ¡Que viva México!, prevailed. Two films utilizing Eisenstein's film footage were made with Upton Sinclair's permission: Thunder over Mexico made in 1933 by Sol Lesser and Time in the Sun, made by Mary Seton in 1939/40. Thanks to the foresight of Sinclair, who in the 1950s deposited the unedited materials of Eisenstein's film with the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the subsequent work of Jay Leyda to make them accessible, all is not lost. We are sure that seventy years of archival care and investment in preserving the essence of this film will eventually result in an authentic reconstruction of this lost film. Many film-historians are convinced that ¡Que viva México! is one of Eisenstein's greatest films. ¡Que viva México! stood at the crossroads of Eisenstein’s artistic development and at a crucial point in the evolution of the art of the cinema. This work deserves more than any other to be taken out of the archives, to be appreciated by a new generation! It is a treasure waiting to be discovered."

        "description": "Triumph of the Will (German: Triumph des Willens) is a propaganda film made by Leni Riefenstahl. It chronicles the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg. The film contains excerpts from speeches given by various Nazi leaders at the Congress, including portions of speeches by Adolf Hitler, interspersed with footage of massed party members. Hitler commissioned the film and served as an unofficial executive producer; his name appears in the opening titles. The overriding theme of the film is the return of Germany as a great power, with Hitler as the True German Leader who will bring glory to the nation. Triumph of the Will was released in 1935 and rapidly became one of the best-known examples of propaganda in film history. Riefenstahl's techniques, such as moving cameras, the use of telephoto lenses to create a distorted perspective, aerial photography, and revolutionary approach to the use of music and cinematography, have earned Triumph recognition as one of the greatest films in history.[1] Riefenstahl won several awards, not only in Germany but also in the United States, France, Sweden, and other countries. The film was popular in the Third Reich and elsewhere, and has continued to influence movies, documentaries, and commercials to this day. English subs"

Along with plenty of laughs and fast paced dialog this film provides a witty and cynical look at news business. There is a slight audio sync problem in the first couple minutes of the film. It is present on the source medium and is very brief."

The reason for her absence was among other things to get a Reno divorce, from, of all people, Walter, who admits he was a bad husband. Hildy divorced Walter largely because she wanted more of a home life, whereas Walter saw her more as a driven hard-boiled reporter than subservient homemaker. Hildy has also come to tell Walter that she is taking the afternoon train to Albany, where she will be getting married tomorrow to staid straight-laced insurance agent, Bruce Baldwin, with whose mother they will live, at least for the first year. Walter doesn't want to lose Hildy, either as a reporter or a wife, and if he does, doesn't believe Bruce is worthy of her. Walter does whatever he can at least to delay Hildy and Bruce's trip, long enough to persuade Hildy to stay for good. His plan includes doing whatever he can to place Bruce in a bad light, while dangling a big story under her nose, namely covering what the newspaper believes is the unfair imminent execution of convicted cop killer, Earl Williams. Hildy doesn't trust Walter in dealing with her and Bruce in an above board manner, but the lure of what potentially may become the biggest story in years, which includes true love, a bumbling sheriff and a corrupt mayor, the latter's actions largely in light of an upcoming election, may prove to be too much for Hildy to resist, especially if it ends up being an exclusive. Regardless of the story outcome, Hildy will have to decide if the thrill of the chase was worth the anguish on her personal life.",

But those who were its captives, the Jewish laborers that had been spared from the ovens, knew that they were on borrowed time and that their only hope was to escape... the only question was how to do it. However, because the Germans would kill an equal number of others whenever a group attempted to escape, the captives knew that if ever an escape was tried, all 600 prisoners in the camp would have to be included... logistically precluding any ideas about tunnels or sneak breakouts. Indeed, to have such a mass escape could only mean that the Ukrainian guards and Germain officers would have to be killed, which many of the Jews felt simply reduced themselves to no better than their captors... thus making it a struggle of conscience. And therein lies the story, with the film being based on a factual account of what then happened at that Sobibor prison.",

All they took however was a simple wooden music box he had bought at auction that day for a mere £2. The box was one of three available for sale and as Holmes and Watson begin to trace the other purchasers, it becomes apparent that someone will stop at nothing, including murder, to retrieve all three. When Holmes learns the identity of the music box maker, he is convinced it contains directions to the retrieval of something very valuable that the government has kept from the public.",

He anxiously awaits the return of his daughter Becky who has been away at school for the last two years. He's also surprised to see that his wife Katherine has also returned. She had left him some years before without really explaining what he had done, but she does make the point of saying that she's returned to take their daughter back to the State Capitol with her. GW is highly respected by everyone around him, including the farmers who are pouring into the territories with free grants of land and the Indians who are under threat of being relocated to another reservation. Between his wife, his headstrong daughter, the crooked land agent and the thieving government Indian agent, GW tries to keep the peace and do what is best for everyone.",

From Africa, Major Martling and Ula Vale launch separate expeditions to find the Goddess and place its secrets in safe hands. Ula's fiance died in an earlier attempt at the same goal and she has taken up the trail in his memory against the advice of her lawyer, Hiram Powers, who covets the Goddess for himself and sends Raglan, a mercenary, to get it for him. Aboard their ship to Guatemala is Lord Greystoke - aka Tarzan - on a mission to find his old friend, d'Arnot, whose plane crashed in the vicinity of the same lost city. Tarzan joins forces with Martling, and they reach the lost city in time to save d'Arnot, but lose the Goddess to Raglan. Ula joins Tarzan and Martling in pursuit of Raglan, whence they must contend with the perils of the jungle, Raglan's henchmen, and a party of primitives from the lost city sent to retrieve the Goddess...",

Later Tom and Ellen attempt a graceful dance number as the ship rolls. Upon arrival Tom holds auditions and meets Anne. There is much indecision by the siblings about their romantic partners even though they are in-the-clouds. Tom dances on the walls and ceiling of his hotel room. All ends well in this light musical. By the way, there is a vaudeville-style dance number in their show that features slapstick. It's a hoot.",

        "description": "German director Fritz Lang is best known for the highly influential films from relatively early in his career, especially Metropolis (1927) and M (1931). But he also had a brief Hollywood heyday during the mid 1940s, when he made some of his best films. Scarlet Street has been claimed by film noir. This attribution is understandable. The lighting is dark, with heavy use of shadows. The characters are all shady as well. Kitty is certainly a femme fatale, although hints are dropped that she is an inherently decent person who has become completely corrupted by Johnny. Being the most naive, Robinson is also the most sympathetic. But even he eventually turns to crime to fulfill his passions. But while Scarlet Street has elements of film noir, it is in reality a black comedy. While Robinson plays it straight throughout, Bennett and Duryea camp it up marvelously. Bennett laughs when Robinson claims to be a painter: \"And here I had you pegged as a cashier!\" She also has to suppress laughter when Robinson reveals that he is married, and shock when Duryea passes her off as the mysterious painter."

After they finished making \"The Flying Deuces,\" they returned to Hal Roach Studios to make films. In order to make this movie, producer Boris Morros bought the rights to the 1931 French film \"Les deux legionnaires,\" which had a similar plot. \"The Flying Deuces\" was Morros' first independent production and it was shot in continuity over a span of four weeks. Only one day was reportedly needed for retakes. The French original starred Fernandel and Noel Noel. SYNOPSIS: Ollie is in love with a woman. When he find out that she is already married, he tries to kill himself. Of course, the suicide is prevented and the boys join the Foreign Legion to get away from their troubles. Eventually, they are arrested for trying to desert the Legion and escape the firing squad by stealing a plane."

      "Plot": "CONTAINS SPOILERS Originally released in 1961 as Five Minutes to Live, this low-budget crime drama was later re-released as Door-to-Door Maniac. Fred narrates the film in flashback, detailing a suburban bank robbery that goes awry. In his simple plan, he hires a hard-up hood, Johnny Cabot to take the wife of the bank's vice president hostage. Cabot will hold her until he gets a call alerting him that Fred has been successful in getting ransom money. Cabot waits, and watches the Wilson house as the husband leaves for the bank and their young son heads off to school. Posing as a door-to-door guitar instructor, he forces his way into the house and takes Nancy Wilson hostage. At the bank, Fred talks his way into Ken Wilson's office, and presents his personal check for $70,000, intending that Wilson will withdraw the funds to cover the check as a ransom for his wife. He has Wilson call home to prove that Nancy is being held by the unstable Cabot, and gives Wilson 5 minutes to make his decision. If Fred fails to call the house back, Cabot is to kill Nancy. Wilson confesses to Fred that he has been planning to run off to Las Vegas with Ellen, the woman he has been having an affair with, and Fred will be doing him a favor by getting rid of Nancy. But as the minutes tick by, Wilson cracks and agrees to give him the money. Fred makes the first call to save Nancy. The clock starts ticking again, another 5 minutes, for Fred to collect the money and get out of the bank safely. While Fred is working on Wilson, Nancy is terrorized by Cabot-- manhandled and shot at, invited to slip into something more comfortable (which she does in a futile attempt to distract him) and finally forced to listen to him serenade her with \"Five Minutes to Live\" and \"I've Come to Kill\" while he waits for the second call. The call hasn't come as Fred has been overpowered by the police, who were alerted by the bank's silent alarm. Cabot is getting more and more stressed. While worrying about Fred not calling, he is completely thrown by Little Bobby arriving home for lunch just as the police arrive at the Wilson house. Cabot panics, grabs Bobby and runs into the yard under police fire. Bobby fakes his death to save himself, and Cabot is shot by a cop in the yard. Nancy is reunited with her now-contrite husband, who decides he will still go to Las Vegas, but with Nancy.By: msb/lll",

When the boy finds two hidden escaped galley convicts, he obeys under, probably unnecessary, threat of a horrible death to bring the criminals food. He must steal at peril of more caning from the battle-ax. Just when Pip fears to get it really good while they have guests, a soldier comes for Joe who takes Pip along as assistant to work on the chains of the escaped galley-convicts, who are soon caught. The better-natured one takes the blame for the stolen food. Later Pip is invited to became the playmate of Estella, the equally arrogant adoptive daughter of gloomy, filthy rich Miss Havisham at her estate, who actually has \"permission\" to break the kind kid's heart. Being the only pretty girl he ever saw, she wins his heart forever, even after a mysterious benefactor pays through a lawyer for his education and a rich allowance, so he can become a snob in London, by now \"ashamed\" of simple Joe. Only after years in idle wealth, Pip learns Havisham is not his benefactor as he assumed, and both her story and those of his real sponsor and Estella.",

        "description": "The Ghoul is a 1933 British Horror film starring Boris Karloff, Cedric Hardwicke, Ernest Thesiger and Ralph Richardson, whose debut film this was. The plot centres around a Professor (Karloff) who is to be buried with an Egyptian jewel in order to attain eternal life. When the jewel is stolen by his servant, the professor rises from the dead to reclaim it. The film, based on the play and novel by Dr. Frank King and Leonard J. Hines, was once considered to be a lost film since the original nitrate negative had succumbed to decomposition and no prints of the film were known to exist. However, an incomplete and partly decomposed Czech release print was discovered which was the only available print for several decades. Then, finally, an excellent quality print was discovered in the archives of the British Film Institute. *****NOTE ABOUT COPYRIGHT STATUS OF THIS WORK***** This version is the Czech print. This item was public domain in the US due to the ommission of a copyright notice and failure to fulfill other copyright formalities. The item remains in the US public domain due to it's public domain status under UK law at the relevant date of GATT/URAA (1 January 1996) rendering it ineligible for restoration of copyright. Transitional terms of UK Copyright legislation stipulate that the copyright term for this film continues to be calculated under the terms of the 1911 UK Copyright Act. This film was released in the UK in 1933. Under the terms of the law at the time, Cinematograph Films were protected as a series of \"Photographs\" with a term of 50 years copyright from the date of publication, a \"sound recording\" with a copyright term of 50 years from recording or publication and a dramatic work of collective authorship with a copyright term of 50 calendar years from the death of the first deceased principal author or the passing of the actual calendar year of the death of the last surviving principal author. The first principle author to die was director T Hayes Hunter (1884-1944). All other principle authors died within 50 years of T Hayes Hunter. As such, under UK Copyright law the film entered the public domain at midnight on 31 December 1994."

Dying from a mysteriously disfiguring ailment, Morlant entrusts his faithful manservant to bandage the jewel in his hand and warns him of dire consequences if his dying wishes aren't carried out. After his burial in an Egyptian-type tomb on his estate, an anonymous robber steals the precious stone from the corpse. Although the ghastly-looking dead man rises at the next full moon to seek revenge, neither he nor the audience know which member of the household possesses the powerful jewel.",

But when the queen delivers a twin, Cardinal Richelieu sees the second son as a potential for revolution, and has him sent off to Spain to be raised in secret to ensure a peaceful future for France. Alas, keeping the secret means sending Constance, lover of D'Artagnan, off to a convent. D'Artagnan hears of this and rallies the Musketeers in a bid to rescue her. Unfortunately, Richelieu out-smarts the Musketeers and banishes them forever. Richelieu enlists D'Artagnan to look after and protect the young prince. Meanwhile, de Rochefort learns of the twins and Richelieu's plans, and kidnaps the twin, raising him in secret. Many years later, with Richelieu dead and the young prince crowned King Louis XIV, Rochefort launches his plan. The king is kidnapped, replaced with his twin, put in an iron mask so as not to be recognized, and led off to a remote castle to be held prisoner. Louis XIV is able to alert D'Artagnan, who realizes that only his friends Athos, Porthos, and Aramis can help him, so he reunites the Musketeers to derail Rochefort's nefarious plot but at a heavy toll.",

J.E.B. Stuart and Custer are assigned to the 2nd Cavalry in the Kansas territory, where they have to deal with John Brown. This copy has better video quality than the one already here in the archive.

        "description": "The End of “Saturn” — Based on the work by V. Ardamatsky, Saturn is Almost Invisible. This gripping Soviet spy thriller is the sequel to The Road to “Saturn”, continuing the dangerous and suspense-filled mission of Soviet intelligence during World War II.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1944, Soviet secret agent Krylov — operating under the Russified German alias “Kramer” — infiltrates the German espionage network and works deep inside the Abwehr spy school “Saturn” in Nazi-occupied Belarus. Risking his life daily, Krylov-Kramer transmits to Moscow intelligence crucial information: the names and identities of enemy saboteurs, their infiltration routes, and their mission signs. This enables the Soviet command to mislead the enemy by sending false radiograms on Soviet troop deployments.\n\nDirected by Villen Azarov, this piece of Cold War–era cinema combines espionage thriller intensity with historical drama accuracy, portraying authentic Soviet underground operations against Hitler’s intelligence. Featuring tense psychological duels, covert missions, and the shadowy world of WWII Soviet spies, The End of “Saturn” stands as a classic of 1960s Soviet war films. Now available with English subtitles, it’s a must-see for fans of Russian historical drama, espionage thrillers, and war films based on true events.\n\nYear of production: 1967\n\nDirector: Azarov Villen\nWriters: Bleiman Mikhail, Ardamatsky Vasily, Azarov Villen\nComposer: Flyarkovsky Alexander\nCamera operator: Dyatlov Mark\nProduction designer: Ushakov Semyon\n\nActors: Lyudmila Maksakova, Georgy Zhzhenov, Vladimir Pokrovsky, Vladimir Kashpur, Mikhail Gluzsky, Nikolay Grabbe, Vladimir Muravyov, Arkady Tolbuzin, Nikolay Prokopovich, Grigory Gai, Bruno Freundlich, Mikhail Volkov, Evgeny Kuznetsov, Nikolay Simkin, Lyudmila Shaposhnikova"

Penniless and stranded, she decides to continue the tour regardless, resorting to hitchhiking and couch-surfing to meet her appointments across Europe, all the while attempting to project an image of success.",

Joel Campbell got so frustrated by his failure to capture Griffin in Los Angeles, that he quit the FBI, moved to Chicago, and remains in psychiatric therapy, unable to function normally. Then he realizes, when opening his mail very late, that a new murder victim is Griffin's, and the killer sent him pictures of her.

The parents call the police to report this strange but jolly intruder. Santa (Dick Van Patten) tries to prove his identity, but is arrested. Judy pleads with her father explaining that millions of kids will go without presents. Santa is placed in jail with Max (Stacy Keach), a ne'er-do-well biker. Back at the Emerson house, Bill is awakened by strange noises and surprised to see live reindeer on the roof. Now a believer, Bill goes to the police station and free Santa Claus. But the bumbling police mistake Max for Santa, and release Max the biker instead. Comic complications ensue, and Christmas hangs in the balance.",

Nor can he find satisfaction at his dead-end job at a small paint store. However, things begin to change when he spies Stephanie Mangano in the disco and starts training with her for the club's dance competition. Stephanie dreams of the world beyond Brooklyn, and her plans to move to Manhattan just over the bridge soon change Tony's life forever.",

Legendary veteran ranger Bill Bell educates the young man and guides him toward manhood. The year is 1919-a time when being a ranger meant more than operating expensive equipment. Forest fires were fought with guts and courage, not chemicals and airplanes. Bill Bell was the toughest ranger in an elite crew of very rugged men. A figure of heroic proportions, he was generally feared and respected by all. It was even rumored that he had at one time killed a sheep farmer, which only fueled his already enormous reputation. The young ranger does everything to remain in the good graces of Bill Bell, the senior ranger he idolizes. Their tentative rapport grows into a friendship through a hilarious and heroic rite of passage in which the younger ranger meets the test-and the woman of his dreams.",

Maxwell's gift of impersonation gets him and Meirschultz past the guards and into a morgue where they use a special serum to revive the corpse of a pretty young woman. But that's nothing. Dr. Meirschultz has a heart beating in a jar of solution and is eager to put it into a corpse that really needs it. Meirschultz gives his assistant a gun and advises him to commit suicide, so that he can put the heart in him, but Maxwell shoots and kills the scientist instead and hides the body. People will miss Meirschultz, Maxwell quickly realizes, but no one will miss his lowly assistant; and so Maxwell dons eyeglasses and a fake beard to become his onetime benefactor. The trouble is, he impersonates the mad doctor too well and goes crazy himself.",

      "Plot": "The war in Europe is over, the Japanese are about to surrender after the Nagasaki bombing, but a group of die-hard German Nazis are holding on in Shanghai, protecting an ingenious invention of mass destruction - a cosmic ray generator that is 1000 times more deadly than the A-bomb. Col. Von Meyer is about to pass the secret of the weapon to Col. Noyoma, as Japan is still at war, and will use it to revenge their recent losses. However, Field Marshal Von Runzel arrives with precise orders to the contrary: the Japanese shall not have the secret weapon, for an underground Nazi ring is to use it later in another attempt to destroy all the Allied Nations, and conquer the world in a third Worl War. Von Meyer decides to create a diversion, and to offer the Japanese scientist and officers some \"evening entertainment\" at the German Officers' Club. Thaler, the female German Officer, is to bring in a number of women - arrested on trumped up charges at the Shanghai University - dress them up, and force them to service the lusty Japanese officers. First, he asks for volunteers, but only the French entertainer Yvette comes forward. The other five women (American, English, Austalian, Russian and Mexican) stubbornly refuse. Then he shouts at them: \"I say, naturally you'll all volunteer!\" The 16-year-old Australian girl finds her mother as a hard-laborer at the club, they rejoice for a while, but knowing that her pure catholic girl will be ravished that night, Mrs. James kills her daughter instead. Her absence will not be missed much, as two other young women arrive, a Chinese and a Japanese. Soon, the Germans are about to betray the Japanese, but the American is in cahoots with an infiltrated German officer who's really her husband (an OSS spy), the Chinese is trying to make the others believe that Maya is an infiltrated Japanese agent, while Lili herself is seeing a Chinese servant of the Germans in secret, and the women are justly suspicious of Yvette - who is getting fond of the bald-head Colonel Von Meyer... In the end, the American plot is uncovered, the Germans and the Japanese start killing each others, and the fugitive American and Chinese spies. A number of people die in heroic gun-fights. Maya is going to defuse the bombs left in the wine cellar by the escaping Americans, so that the Japanese will get the secret weapon in the end. However Yvette decides to change her loyalty to her country, thinking of what the English girl told her. The two women clash in a desperate fight all over the place, as the fuse is burning - with the future of humankind at stake.",

There was Vera Brittain, an upper class girl with ideas of her own; and her bright brother Edward; and his group of friends among whom Roland Leighton, wonderful, handsome, sensitive Roland Vera had fallen for... Always having great times together talking, laughing, exchanging ideas, walking, eating, swimming together; all of them envisioning the glittering future they deserved: Vera, despite her father's opposition, would study at Oxford, marry Roland and be a famous writer; Roland, as for him, would be acclaimed as a great poet while Edward and his friends would each become a prominent figure in his respective field... But then came that fateful day on 4 August 1914 when Britain declared war on Germany. All those beautiful dreams were to be shattered one after the other. All except one: Vera wound up becoming a writer... A writer but a pacifist as well.",

When David Richmond, a progressive young minister, arrives in Gladbury, the villagers discover a new formula for miracles: good deeds and acts of kindness. While David's quest to modernize Gladbury sets him at odds with the old world candlemaker, he finds an unlikely ally in the lovely skeptic, Emily Barstow. Now, the fiery candlemaker must fight to preserve the legacy of the Christmas Candle, but when the blessed candle goes missing, the miraculous and human collide in the most astonishing Christmas the village of Gladbury has ever seen.",

An example of such behavior is performing in or attending burlesque shows, which promote casual sex. Indeed, many in the audience at one burlesque show in New York have only sex on their minds, including young unmarried couple James and Jane, office colleagues Peggy and Betty (Peggy is trying to seduce Betty), and Paul Lorenz's own son Tom, who is anticipating an aftershow group-sex party that will include some of the girls from the show, such as Sheila Wayne, who has syphilis but treats it as casually as her sexual encounters. Her fellow showgirl Millicent Hamilton will not be at the party. Millicent was once a small-town girl who was planning to marry her beau, Wendel Hope, until she won a beauty contest. Her prize was a trip to New York, but she found life there more difficult than she expected, and a sexual encounter associated with trying to advance her show-business career resulted in her also contracting syphilis. Respected Dr. Hampton informs her that she can fully recover and eventually marry Wendel if she takes the slow and intensive but proven therapy, but when she leaves New York for home--which means therapy with another doctor--Dr. Hampton warns her to beware of quacks who might promise expensive miracle cures. Will she heed Dr. Hampton's advice, or will she fall prey to the hope of a quick cure so that she can marry Wendel sooner?",

        "description": "Considered THE archetypal sensationalized anti-drug movie, but it's really an exploitation film made to capitalize on the hot taboo subject of marijuana use. Like many exploitation films of the time, \"Reefer Madness\" tried to make a quick buck off of a forbidden subject while skirting the Motion Picture Production Code of 1930. The Code forbade the portrayal of immoral acts like drug use. ( The illegal drug traffic must not be portrayed in such a way as to stimulate curiosity concerning the use of, or traffic in, such drugs; nor shall scenes be approved which show the use of illegal drugs, or their effects, in detail. ) The film toured around the country for many years - often being re-edited and re-titled (\"Tell Your Children\", \"Dope Addict\", \"Doped Youth\", \"Love Madness\", \"The Burning Question\"). It was re-discovered in the early 1970s by NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) and screened again as an example of the government's demonization of marijuana. NORML may have been confused about the film's sponsorship since one of the film's distributors, Dwain Esper, testified to the Arizona Supreme Court that \"Reefer Madness\" was not a trashy exploitation film but was actually sponsored by the U.S. Government - a convincing lie, but a lie nonetheless. That being said, the film is still quick enjoyable since it dramatizes the \"violent narcotic's ... soul destroying\" effects on unwary teens, and their hedonistic exploits enroute to the bottom. You can find more information regarding this film on its IMDb page . Also, if you are interested in the rich, uniquely American history of exploitation films, there are two excellent books on the subject: \"Forbidden Fruit - The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\", Felicia Feaster and Bret Wood, Midnight Marquee Press, 1999. \"Bold! Daring! Shocking! True! A History of Exploitation Films, 1919 - 1959\" Eric Schaefer, Duke University Press, 1999."

        "description": "This is a typical sex exploitation film from the early 1930s - complete with wild parties, sex out of wedlock, lesbianism, etc. A chorus girl's exposure to the \"casting couch\" also exposes her to syphilis. Exploitation filmmakers hoped to capitalize on the taboo subjects of venereal disease, sex before marriage, lesbianism, etc. while skirting the Motion Picture Production Code of 1930 which forbade a film from containing such content. Films like this would tour the United States for years - mostly being shown in rundown, skid row theaters. This film has been re-edited and re-titled (\"Human Wreckage\", \"They Must Be Told\", \"Trial Marriage\", \"About Trial Marriage\") many times to attract the same audience to film, to take advantage of a taboo subject which may have gotten press recently or to appease local censors who disapproved of the film's content. You can find more information regarding this film on its IMDb page . Also, if you are interested in the rich, uniquely American history of exploitation films, there are two excellent books on the subject: \"Forbidden Fruit - The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\", Felicia Feaster and Bret Wood, Midnight Marquee Press, 1999. \"Bold! Daring! Shocking! True! A History of Exploitation Films, 1919 - 1959\" Eric Schaefer, Duke University Press, 1999",

        "description": "Considered THE archetypal sensationalized anti-drug movie, but it's really an exploitation film made to capitalize on the hot taboo subject of marijuana use. Like many exploitation films of the time, \"Reefer Madness\" tried to make a quick buck off of a forbidden subject while skirting the Motion Picture Production Code of 1930. The Code forbade the portrayal of immoral acts like drug use. ( The illegal drug traffic must not be portrayed in such a way as to stimulate curiosity concerning the use of, or traffic in, such drugs; nor shall scenes be approved which show the use of illegal drugs, or their effects, in detail. ) The film toured around the country for many years - often being re-edited and re-titled (\"Tell Your Children\", \"Dope Addict\", \"Doped Youth\", \"Love Madness\", \"The Burning Question\"). It was re-discovered in the early 1970s by NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) and screened again as an example of the government's demonization of marijuana. NORML may have been confused about the film's sponsorship since one of the film's distributors, Dwain Esper, testified to the Arizona Supreme Court that \"Reefer Madness\" was not a trashy exploitation film but was actually sponsored by the U.S. Government - a convincing lie, but a lie nonetheless. That being said, the film is still quick enjoyable since it dramatizes the \"violent narcotic's ... soul destroying\" effects on unwary teens, and their hedonistic exploits enroute to the bottom. You can find more information regarding this film on its IMDb page . Also, if you are interested in the rich, uniquely American history of exploitation films, there are two excellent books on the subject: \"Forbidden Fruit - The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\", Felicia Feaster and Bret Wood, Midnight Marquee Press, 1999. \"Bold!

But he also had a brief Hollywood heyday during the mid 1940s, when he made some of his best films. Scarlet Street has been claimed by film noir. This attribution is understandable. The lighting is dark, with heavy use of shadows. The characters are all shady as well. Kitty is certainly a femme fatale, although hints are dropped that she is an inherently decent person who has become completely corrupted by Johnny. Being the most naive, Robinson is also the most sympathetic. But even he eventually turns to crime to fulfill his passions. But while Scarlet Street has elements of film noir, it is in reality a black comedy. While Robinson plays it straight throughout, Bennett and Duryea camp it up marvelously. Bennett laughs when Robinson claims to be a painter: \"And here I had you pegged as a cashier!\" She also has to suppress laughter when Robinson reveals that he is married, and shock when Duryea passes her off as the mysterious painter.",

        "description": "This was the first comedy that Laurel and Hardy starred in without producer Hal Roach, although they had previously been \"guest stars\" in four MGM movies. After they finished making \"The Flying Deuces,\" they returned to Hal Roach Studios to make films. In order to make this movie, producer Boris Morros bought the rights to the 1931 French film \"Les deux legionnaires,\" which had a similar plot. \"The Flying Deuces\" was Morros' first independent production and it was shot in continuity over a span of four weeks. Only one day was reportedly needed for retakes. The French original starred Fernandel and Noel Noel. SYNOPSIS: Ollie is in love with a woman. When he find out that she is already married, he tries to kill himself. Of course, the suicide is prevented and the boys join the Foreign Legion to get away from their troubles. Eventually, they are arrested for trying to desert the Legion and escape the firing squad by stealing a plane.",

        "description": "The Ghoul is a 1933 British Horror film starring Boris Karloff, Cedric Hardwicke, Ernest Thesiger and Ralph Richardson, whose debut film this was. The plot centres around a Professor (Karloff) who is to be buried with an Egyptian jewel in order to attain eternal life. When the jewel is stolen by his servant, the professor rises from the dead to reclaim it. The film, based on the play and novel by Dr. Frank King and Leonard J. Hines, was once considered to be a lost film since the original nitrate negative had succumbed to decomposition and no prints of the film were known to exist. However, an incomplete and partly decomposed Czech release print was discovered which was the only available print for several decades. Then, finally, an excellent quality print was discovered in the archives of the British Film Institute. *****NOTE ABOUT COPYRIGHT STATUS OF THIS WORK***** This version is the Czech print. This item was public domain in the US due to the ommission of a copyright notice and failure to fulfill other copyright formalities. The item remains in the US public domain due to it's public domain status under UK law at the relevant date of GATT/URAA (1 January 1996) rendering it ineligible for restoration of copyright. Transitional terms of UK Copyright legislation stipulate that the copyright term for this film continues to be calculated under the terms of the 1911 UK Copyright Act. This film was released in the UK in 1933. Under the terms of the law at the time, Cinematograph Films were protected as a series of \"Photographs\" with a term of 50 years copyright from the date of publication, a \"sound recording\" with a copyright term of 50 years from recording or publication and a dramatic work of collective authorship with a copyright term of 50 calendar years from the death of the first deceased principal author or the passing of the actual calendar year of the death of the last surviving principal author. The first principle author to die was director T Hayes Hunter (1884-1944). All other principle authors died within 50 years of T Hayes Hunter. As such, under UK Copyright law the film entered the public domain at midnight on 31 December 1994.",

This film is also known as \"The Gill Women\" and \"The Gill Women of Venus\". This film began life as a Soviet-produced work. An American producer then added some new footage and changed the credits to hide the film's Soviet origin. The original film, \"Planeta Bur\", is also known as \"Cosmonauts on Venus\", \"Planet of Storms\", \"Planet of Tempests\", \"Planeta Burg\", and \"Storm Planet\". Much of the film \"Planeta Bur\" was also incorporated into the \"American\" film \"Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet\" . This film was shown in \"Pathe\" color, which is essentially just a method of placing color filters over a black and white film. Consequently, the color that you see is not the true color of the sets but instead represents an \"interpretation\" of a black and white original. This film can be downloaded as a Theora file. The file size is approximately 25% larger than the MPEG-2, with similar quality. Simply click on this link . You can find more information regarding this film on its IMDb page .

        "description": "Sergei Eisenstein shot ¡Que viva México! in Mexico in 1931 at the height of the Great Depression. The courageous financiers of this project were the author Upton Sinclair, his wife Mary Craig and a small group of their friends. They had great difficulties in keeping the production going; the economic crisis forced Sinclair to call a halt to it in early 1932. Shooting was stopped with most of the work completed; only one episode could not be filmed. At the same time Josef Stalin insisted on Eisenstein's return to the Soviet Union. Eisenstein left Mexico with Sinclair's promise in mind; that all the negatives would be send to him to enable the final editing of the film in Moscow. Sinclair tried several times in vain to transfer the film footage to Russia, but the Soviet Film Industry was instructed not to import the film. Eisenstein had been denounced both as a political renegade and as a Trotskyite, which was, in the eyes of Stalin, a serious offence. Preventing Eisenstein from finishing his Mexican film was Stalin's punishment. Consequently Eisenstein was left without film work for several years and started teaching at the State Film School. The Stalinist propaganda, which heaped all the blame on Upton Sinclair for the tragic end of ¡Que viva México!, prevailed. Two films utilizing Eisenstein's film footage were made with Upton Sinclair's permission: Thunder over Mexico made in 1933 by Sol Lesser and Time in the Sun, made by Mary Seton in 1939/40. Thanks to the foresight of Sinclair, who in the 1950s deposited the unedited materials of Eisenstein's film with the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the subsequent work of Jay Leyda to make them accessible, all is not lost. We are sure that seventy years of archival care and investment in preserving the essence of this film will eventually result in an authentic reconstruction of this lost film. Many film-historians are convinced that ¡Que viva México! is one of Eisenstein's greatest films. ¡Que viva México! stood at the crossroads of Eisenstein’s artistic development and at a crucial point in the evolution of the art of the cinema. This work deserves more than any other to be taken out of the archives, to be appreciated by a new generation! It is a treasure waiting to be discovered.",

Una película que explora situaciones para una imagen fresca de las situaciones sociales. Una comedia con el don de crear una imagen diferente de la época, utilizando la ironía y los clichés, los deseos y los matices. Una película que se mantiene encantadora década tras década, y esa es la virtud fundamental del cine.

Otra innovación de los creadores de la película es que la narración se realiza en forma de entrevistas con personas, de forma documental. Evgeny Khobotov es el nuevo médico jefe de un hospital psiquiátrico. Nos presenta a Ivan Gromov, que tiene una manía de persecución. Resulta que el anterior médico jefe, el Dr. Ragin, lo consideraba... un profeta. Ahora Ragin está en este hospital como paciente. \n\nPero, ¿cómo sucedió que una persona sana, después de comunicarse con un enfermo mental, pierde la cabeza? ¿Cómo cruzó esta línea? Y, en general, ¿no es ilusoria la línea entre los enfermos mentales y las personas normales? ¿Quizás sería cierto decir que usted y yo sufrimos diferentes formas de enfermedad mental? De una forma u otra, los colegas y familiares del Dr. Ragin están tratando de comprender por qué la visita a la sala número 6 fue fatal para el médico jefe.\n\nAño de producción: 2006\n\nDirectores: Shakhnazarov Karen, Gornovsky Alexander\nEscritores: Alexander Borodyansky, Karen Shakhnazarov\nCompositor: Evgeniy Kadimsky\nOperador: Kuznetsov Alexander\nDiseño de producción: Kusakova Lyudmila\n\nReparto: Pankratov-Cherny Alexander, Ilyin Vladimir, Zharkov Alexey, Stychkin Evgeniy, Soloviev Victor, Vertkov Alexey, Evtushevskaya Albina, Kuznetsov Alexander",

        "description": "Incredible rumors circulate among Soviet soldiers about a mysterious German tank that suddenly appears and disappears on the battlefield, destroying everything in its path. This is the White Tiger, the devil no one can handle. After one of such battles, a badly burnt tank driver is found in a disabled Soviet tank. Surviving such monstrous burns is impossible, but the tank driver is quickly on the mend. Doctors are perplexed and throw up their hands, assuring that it’s a miracle. \n\nStill, this man does not remember who he is, where he comes from, but he knows one thing - the mystical German tank does exist. He believes that the war has given him back his life to rid the world of the killer tank, the White Tiger. What’s that? A fantasy? A mirage? Third Reich’s secret weapon? Or did he discover the ultimate secret of the war?  \n\nYear of production: 2012\n\nDirected by: Karen Shakhnazarov \nWritten by: Aleksandr Borodyansky, Karen Shakhnazarov\nDirectors of photography: Alexander Kuznetsov, Alik Tagirov \nMusic: Yuri Poteyenko, Konstantin Shevelev\nProduction designers: Sergei Fevralev, Irina Ochina\n\nStarring: Alexei Vertkov, Vitaly Kishchenko, Valery Grishko, Alexander Vakhov, Dmitry Bykovsky, Gerasim Arkhipov, Vitaly Dordzhiev, Vladimir Ilyin, Maria Shashlova, Carl Kranzkowski, Christian Redl, Klaus Grünberg, Wilmar Biri",

        "description": "The film's script is based on A.P. Chekhov's story \"Ward No. 6\", but the film's action has been moved to the present time. Another innovation of the creators of the film is that the narration is conducted in the form of interviews with people, in a documentary manner. \n\nEvgeny Khobotov is the new head physician of a psychiatric hospital. He introduces us to Ivan Gromov, who has a persecution mania. It turns out that the previous chief physician, Dr. Ragin, considered him... a prophet. Now Ragin is in this hospital as a patient. But how did it happen that a healthy person, after communicating with a mentally ill person, loses his mind? How did he cross this line? And in general, isn’t the line between mentally ill people and normal people illusory? Perhaps it would be true to say that you and I all suffer from different forms of mental illness? One way or another, Dr. Ragin’s colleagues and relatives are trying to understand why the visit to ward No. 6 was fatal for the physician.\n\nYear of production: 2009\n\nDirectors: Shakhnazarov Karen, Gornovsky Alexander\nWriters: Alexander Borodyansky, Karen Shakhnazarov\nComposer: Evgeniy Kadimsky\nOperator: Kuznetsov Alexander\nProduction designer: Kusakova Lyudmila\n\nCast: Pankratov-Cherny Alexander, Ilyin Vladimir, Zharkov Alexey, Stychkin Evgeniy, Soloviev Victor, Vertkov Alexey, Evtushevskaya Albina, Kuznetsov Alexander",

Il y a des rumeurs incroyables parmi les soldats soviétiques au sujet d'un mystérieux char allemand qui apparaît de nulle part sur le champ de bataille et disparaît également nulle part, détruisant tout sur son passage. \n\nIl s'agit du «Tigre Blanc », le diable lui-même, qui est trop coriace pour tout un bataillon de chars. Un jour, un soldat grièvement brûlé est retrouvé dans un char soviétique endommagé. Il est impossible de survivre avec des brûlures aussi monstrueuses, mais le pétrolier se remet rapidement. Les médecins haussent les épaules avec perplexité – c’est un miracle, rien d’autre. Cet homme ne se souvient pas de qui il est ni d'où il vient, mais il sait une chose : le char mystique allemand existe réellement. \n\nPour combattre le Tigre Blanc, le commandement soviétique décide de créer un modèle spécial basé sur le T-34-85. Maintenant, nous devons tout faire pour détruire le Tigre Blanc.\n\nAnnée de production : 2012\n\nRéalisateur : Chakhnazarov Karen\nScénaristes : Alexandre Borodianski, Karen Shakhnazarov\nCompositeurs : Poteenko Yuri, Shevelev Konstantin\nOpérateurs : Tagirov Alik (Azer), Kuznetsov Alexander\nDécorateurs : Sergueï Fevralev, Irina Ochina\n\nActeurs : Ilyin Vladimir, Vertkov Alexey, Kishchenko Vitaly, Soloviev Victor, Arkhipov Gerasim, Biri Wilmar, Bykovsky-Romashov Dmitry, Grishko Valery, Dordzhiev Vitaly, Kranzkovsky Karl, Martens Dirk, Redl Christian, Schenk Michael",

Here is the original story of the Soviet director Eldar Ryazanov. Favorite New Year movie of all Russians!\n\nFIRST EPISODE. The Irony of Fate, or Enjoy Your Bath!  is a 1976 Soviet romantic comedy television film directed by Eldar Ryazanov. The screenplay was written by Emil Braginsky and Ryazanov, loosely based on the director's 1971 play, Once on New Year's Eve. Filmed in 1975 at the Mosfilm Studios, The Irony of Fate doubles as a screwball comedy and a love story tinged with sadness. It was one of the most successful Soviet television productions and remains a highly popular New Year's Eve classic in Russia and the post-Soviet states, with millions tuning in to rewatch it every New Year's Eve.\n\nThe key subplot is the drab uniformity of Brezhnev-era public architecture. This setting is explained in a humorous animated prologue, in which architects are overruled by politicians and red tape. As a result, the identical, functional but unimaginative multistory apartment buildings found their way into every city, town, and suburb across the Soviet Union.\n\nFollowing their annual tradition, a group of friends meet at a banya (a traditional public \"sauna\" bath) in Moscow to celebrate New Year's Eve. The friends all get very drunk toasting the upcoming marriage of the central male character, Zhenya Lukashin (Andrey Myagkov) to Galya (Olga Naumenko). After the bath, one of the friends, Pavlik (Aleksandr Shirvindt), has to catch a plane to Leningrad. Zhenya, on the other hand, is supposed to go home to celebrate New Year's Eve with his fiancée. Both Zhenya and Pavlik pass out. The remaining friends cannot remember which person from their group is supposed to catch the plane.

        "description": "A Soviet-Cuban two-part feature film directed by Mikhail Kalatozov, released in 1964. The film was shot after the triumph of the Cuban revolution, the advent of the socialist regime in Cuba, and allied relations between Cuba and the USSR.\n\nPlot-wise, it consists of four unrelated novellas that tell the story of the Cubans fighting against \"American oppressors\" to turn their country into the Island of Liberty. In the 1960s, due to the rise of socialist ideals, the theme of revolution became relevant both for Soviet and Western cinema.\nThe film is made on a high professional level, primarily due to the innovations of DP Sergey Urusevsky and his crew. This was the last time Urusevsky, and director Kalatozov worked together. The films’s production was challenging in regards to staging, camerawork, intraframe editing, hand-held shooting for creating dynamic scenes using a hand-held camera in motion and transferring it from hand to hand, using specially made engineering structures, etc.\n\nThe film was shot between 1963 and 1964 with a considerable support from the Soviet and Cuban authorities during one of the most strained episodes of the Cold War - the Cuban Missile Crisis, the US blockade of the island, and the difficult economic situation in Cuba.\n\nYear of production: 1964\n\nDirected by: Mikhail Kalatozov\nWritten by: Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Enrique Pineda Barnet\nDirector of photography: Sergei Urusevsky\nMusic: Carlos Fariñas\nProduction designer: Yevgeni Svidetelev\nStarring: Sergio Corrieri, José Gallardo, Raúl García, Salvador Wood, Luz María Collazo, Jean Bouise, Celia Rodriguez\n\nThe film was digitally restored by Mosfilm Cinema Concern\nFind out more: https://cg.mosfilm.ru/en\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel, and be sure to click the bell so that you won’t miss the best Soviet movies!\n\n#FullMoviesWithEngSubs #Cuba #Kalatozov",

        "description": "Georgiy Daneliya’s famous comedy is a kind, funny, and at the same time a sad story about a hopeless plumber Afanasy ‘Afonya’ Borshchov, who fills his life with dubious ”exploits,“ new acquaintances, and booze. Although Afonya has no respect for work, his coworkers and Katya, a girl in love with him, hope that Afanasy will change for the better. After all, he’s not doing anything wrong - he’s just being indifferent. Can anything spark his seemingly dormant heart? \n\nA film about the transience of time, the need for choice, and love.

        "description": "A Soviet ‘Red Western’ classic. The Russian civil war is over, but Basmachi gangs still roam Central Asia. Fyodor Ivanovich Sukhov, a Red Army soldier, intends to return home to his beloved wife Katerina Matveyevna, but unexpected events force him to stay in the desert. The brutal bandit Abdullah and his gang kill everyone in their path and threaten to destroy the women of their leader’s former harem. \n\nFun facts: Film scholars believed that White Sun of the Desert had much in common with such films as The Passenger by Antonioni, The Sheltering Sky by Bertolucci, and Soviet movie The Thirteen by Mikhail Romm. In 2021, a distant Western reference might be Django Unchained by Quentin Tarantino. Therefore, the genre of the movie is vague. Film critics define the movie as a western, a red western (or eastern), and even an action flick. Many quotes from White Sun of the Desert have become catchphrases in Russian culture. The song Your Noble Highness Lady Fortune, written especially for the movie, became a hit.\n\nThe Red Western as a genre, with films such as The Elusive Avengers, Dauria, At Home Among the Strangers, and White Sun of the Desert, to name a few, became a relevant phenomenon in the Soviet film industry, causing a wave of imitations in the 60-70s, both in central studios and in film studios of the Central Asian republics.\n\nYear of production: 1969\n\nDirected by: Vladimir Motyl \nWritten by: Valentin Ezhov, Rustam Ibragimbekov \nDirector of photography: Eduard Rozovsky \nMusic: Isaac Schwartz \nProduction designer: Valery Kostrin, Bella Manevich \nStarring: Anatoly Kuznetsov, Nikolay Godovikov, Galina Luchai, Spartak Mishulin, Kakhi Kavsadze, Pavel Luspekayev, Tatiana Fedotova\n\nThe film was digitally restored by Mosfilm Cinema Concern\nFind out more: https://cg.mosfilm.ru/en\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel, and be sure to click the bell so that you won’t miss the best Soviet movies! \n\n#eastern #your_honor #western #FullMoviesWithEngSubs",

A military tribunal is investigating the actions of an arrested inexperienced young lieutenant Ogarkov. \n\nOfficer Ivan Sinyayev, who was on a mission together with Ogarkov, thinks that Ogarkov showed cowardice.

        "description": "¡Que viva México! is an unfinished movie by Sergei Eisenstein made between 1931 and 1932. The movie was conceived as a broad picture of life in Mexico in different eras and under different social systems. Eisenstein formulated the idea of the movie as follows: ¡Que viva México! is the history of the shifts of culture, given not vertically, in years and centuries, but horizontally, in the order of the geographical cohabitation of the most diverse stages of culture side by side - a unique feature of Mexico where provinces of reigning matriarchy (Tehuantepec) border regions of communism almost achieved in the revolution of the 1910s (Yucatan, Zapatismo, etc.). \n\nThe making of Long Live Mexico has a fascinating history. In the autumn of 1929, a group of Soviet filmmakers headed by Eisenstein went to Hollywood, where they were supposed to learn the technique of sound cinema and produce a movie for Paramount Pictures. American and Mexican friends, including the famous artists Diego Rivera and David Siqueiros, writers Theodore Dreiser and Upton Sinclair, offered Eisenstein’s group an exciting idea with funding to shoot a feature movie about life in Mexico. \n\nIn its original form, the movie consisted of two novellas, Sandunga and Maguey, and three episodes framing the novellas, the Prologue, the Spanish-Catholic Mexico scenes, and the Epilogue. \n\nThe Prologue shows scenes of ancient Mexico, temples, and pyramids. Sandunga is an idyllic novella about matriarchal pre-colonial Mexico. The plot slowly unfolds around a young Indian couple. This novella was filmed in Oaxaca. \n\nNext, the viewer is introduced to Mexico after the Spanish conquest, which brought lavish festivities and the worship of the Blessed Virgin. Eisenstein managed to film the celebration of the 400th anniversary of the miraculous icon of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico. He depicted here the self-torture of penitents, pilgrim processions, religious dances, and bullfighting. \nThe second novella is called Maguey, Agave maguey juice is used to make pulque. The novella is set on a maguey plantation during the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz. The audience is presented with pictures of the hard work and suffering of peons. A drunken guest of the hacienda owner takes peon Sebastian’s beloved girl away from him. But the peon decides to take revenge and burns down the owner’s estate with the help of his three friends. However, the peons are caught and end up with a painful execution, buried up to their necks in the sand and trampled by horses. \n\nThe last and climactic novella, Soldadera, revolving around the Mexican Revolution, was not finished. As conceived by the director, it would tell the story of a girl named Pancha, the wife of a soldier of the Constitutional Army of Venustiano Carranza. Along with the other soldier’s wives, soldaderas who cook food for the troops and care for the wounded, she accompanies her husband on the campaigns. Her husband is killed on the battlefield, and Pancha becomes the wife of the enemy - a soldier fighting on Zapata’s side. It turns out that Pancha not only switches a husband but also joins another army, with which she enters Mexico City after joining Villa’s troops. In this way, Pancha embodies Mexico itself, driven by the fratricidal war between the various revolutionary forces. This novella would thus cap one of the themes of the movie - the relationship between a man and a woman - from a serene pastime in the pre-colonial era, to fighting for their rights in the feudal era, to ultimately fighting shoulder-to-shoulder in the revolution.\n \nThe last episode was supposed to be an Epilogue to celebrate the Day of the Dead. The viewer sees a parade of people dressed in skeleton costumes. There are skulls in tricornes of generals and ministers, skulls in toppers, and skeletons in bishop’s vestments. People in death masks dance to the sound of the rumba. But they take off their masks, and we see the faces of children, peons, and laborers. \n\nAt various times, 80,000 meters of footage shot by Eisenstein’s group were edited into feature films Thunder over Mexico and Time under the Sun. Selected footage has been used in various films, such as Viva, Villa! In 1955, Sinclair donated the entire negative to the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Due to Sergei Eisenstein’s problems with the Soviet authorities and Stalin in particular, Soviet viewers saw Long Live Mexico! Only after the director died in 1979. Eisenstein’s co-director Grigori Alexandrov edited a version close to the original idea. \n\nYear of production: 1932, 1978 \n\nDirected by: Sergei Eisenstein, Grigori Alexandrov, Nikita Orlov\nWritten by: Grigory Alexandrov,Sergei Eisenstein\nDirectors of photography: Eduard Tisse, Nikolai Olonovsky\nMusic: Yury Yakhushev\nProduction designer: Yury Sobolev\nStarring: Sergei Bondarchuk (voiceover), Grigory Alexandrov (cameo)\n\n#Mexican_history #Film_history #Sergei_Eisenstein #FullMoviesWithEngSubs",

In 1984, it was recognized as the best film of the year by Soviet Screen magazine and won several awards. A brilliant role for Nikita Mikhalkov and a tender debut for Larisa Guzeeva. The film differs significantly from its source material, and is considered by many a piece of work in its own right. It is set in a small provincial town on the coast of the Volga River. Kharita Ignatievna Ogudalova is a widow with three grown-up daughters. Having become poor after the death of her husband Dmitry Stepanovich, she does everything to arrange for her daughters, that is, to marry them off to sufficiently rich and noble suitors. Despite her lack of funds, she keeps an open house, reckoning that the company of beautiful, musically gifted young ladies will attract single men rich enough to marry the dowerless... \n\nThe drama of the love affair between a destitute woman and a rich ship-owner is intensified by the social problem of the woman’s situation in the era of the decline of nobility as a class in the Russian Empire. \n\nYear of production: 1984\n\nWritten and directed by: Eldar Ryazanov \nDirector of photography: Vadim Alisov \nMusic: Andrey Petrov \nProduction designer: Alexander Borisov \nStarring: Larisa Guzeeva, Nikita Mikhalkov, Alisa Freindlich, Andrey Myagkov, Alexey Petrenko, Viktor Proskurin\n\nThe film was digitally restored by Mosfilm Cinema Concern\nFind out more: https://cg.mosfilm.ru/en\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel, and be sure to click the bell so that you won’t miss the best Soviet movies! \n\n#Guzeeva #Mikhalkov #cruel_love #FullMovieWithEngSubs",
