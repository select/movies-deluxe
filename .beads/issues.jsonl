This means we can only scrape the first 100-200 movies sorted by downloads.\n\n**Root Cause**: Archive.org API returns identical results for different start values (e.g., start=190 and start=200 return the same movies).\n\n**Current Workaround**: Autodetect now starts from page 0 and skips existing movies, but this doesn't help us access movies beyond the first 100-200 results.\n\n**Potential Solutions**:\n1. Use different sort orders (date, title, etc.) to access different subsets\n2. Use different collection filters\n3. Use Archive.org's alternative APIs or scraping methods\n4.

First attempt: Search with exact year\n     b. If no match: Search without year, then filter results for ±2 year range\n   - Example: Movie from 1999 should match OMDB results from 1997-2001\n   - Update matchMovie() in server/utils/omdb.ts\n\n3. **Enhanced failure tracking in failed-omdb.json**\n   - Current: Only stores imdbId and title\n   - Improved: Store all attempted title queries and year used\n   - Format:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"imdbId\": \"yt-abc123\",\n       \"originalTitle\": \"1934 Director Unknown Pipin Der Kurze\",\n       \"year\": 1934,\n       \"attempts\": [\n         { \"query\": \"Pipin Der Kurze\", \"year\": 1934 },\n         { \"query\": \"Pipin Der Kurze\", \"year\": null }\n       ],\n       \"lastAttempt\": \"2024-12-23T20:00:00Z\"\n     }\n     ```\n   - Update saveFailedOmdbMatch() in server/utils/failedOmdb.ts\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Better matching for Archive.org titles with \"Director Unknown\"\n- More flexible year matching catches movies with incorrect years\n- Better debugging with detailed failure tracking\n- Can analyze which cleaning strategies work best\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- server/utils/titleCleaner.ts (add \"Director Unknown\" removal)\n- server/utils/omdb.ts (flexible year matching)\n- server/utils/failedOmdb.ts (enhanced failure tracking)\n- shared/types/movie.ts (update FailedOmdbMatch type if needed)","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T23:06:49.841444705+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-23T23:15:16.000825897+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-23T23:15:16.000825897+01:00"}
