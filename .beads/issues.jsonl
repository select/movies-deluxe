This means we can only scrape the first 100-200 movies sorted by downloads.\n\n**Root Cause**: Archive.org API returns identical results for different start values (e.g., start=190 and start=200 return the same movies).\n\n**Current Workaround**: Autodetect now starts from page 0 and skips existing movies, but this doesn't help us access movies beyond the first 100-200 results.\n\n**Potential Solutions**:\n1. Use different sort orders (date, title, etc.) to access different subsets\n2. Use different collection filters\n3. Use Archive.org's alternative APIs or scraping methods\n4. Accept the limitation and focus on the most popular movies\n\n**Impact**: We can only scrape ~100 unique movies from Archive.org's feature_films collection, not the full 26,779 available.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-23T00:17:58.80892753+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-23T03:12:42.858714016+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-23T03:12:42.858714016+01:00"}

{"id":"movies-deluxe-fksu","title":"Epic: SQLite Migration","description":"Migrate from in-memory JSON/Fuse.js to SQLite Wasm.\n\nDetailed Strategy:\n1. **Source of Truth**: 'public/data/movies.json' remains the primary source of truth. A generation script will convert it to 'public/data/movies.db' as a build/post-scrape step.\n2. **Field Analysis \u0026 Optimization**: To minimize database size and memory footprint, only fields used in the UI are stored in the database. Unused metadata (e.g., individual ratings, AI extraction details not shown to users) is excluded.\n3. **Schema Design**:\n   - 'movies' table: Primary metadata (imdbId, title, year, rated, runtime, genre, director, writer, actors, plot, language, country, awards, imdbRating, imdbVotes).\n   - 'sources' table: Relational storage for movie sources (archive.org, youtube) with source-specific fields.\n   - 'fts_movies' (FTS5): Virtual table for high-performance full-text search across title, actors, director, and plot.\n4. **Client-Side Implementation**:\n   - Use '@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm' to load the database in the browser.\n   - Implement a Web Worker to handle database initialization and queries.\n   - Create a Nuxt composable 'useDatabase' to abstract SQL queries.\n5. **Benefits**:\n   - **Performance**: SQL is significantly faster for filtering/sorting 18k+ records.\n   - **Memory**: Drastically reduced memory footprint by only loading necessary fields and using SQLite's paging.\n   - **Search**: FTS5 provides more powerful and faster search than Fuse.js.","status":"open","priority":4,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-23T17:45:08.725138763+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-23T18:27:11.70336053+01:00"}
