{"id":"movies-deluxe-3695","title":"Types: Update TypeScript types for dynamic filter options","description":"# Types: Update TypeScript Types for Dynamic Filter Options\n\n## Objective\nUpdate TypeScript types to support dynamic filter options instead of const string literals.\n\n## Current State\nTypes are defined as const arrays in constants/filters.ts:\n```typescript\nexport type YouTubeChannel = (typeof YOUTUBE_CHANNELS)[number]\nexport type Genre = (typeof AVAILABLE_GENRES)[number]\nexport type Country = (typeof AVAILABLE_COUNTRIES)[number]\n```\n\nThis creates literal types like: `\"Drama\" | \"Comedy\" | \"Action\" | ...`\n\n## New Approach\nSince filter options are now dynamic (loaded from database), we need to change these to simple string types while maintaining type safety where possible.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### 1. Create shared/types/filters.ts\n```typescript\n/**\n * Filter option types for Movies Deluxe\n * These are now dynamic and loaded from the database\n */\n\nexport interface GenreOption {\n  name: string\n  count: number\n}\n\nexport interface CountryOption {\n  name: string\n  count: number\n}\n\nexport interface ChannelOption {\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  count: number\n}\n\n// API response types\nexport interface GenresResponse {\n  genres: GenreOption[]\n}\n\nexport interface CountriesResponse {\n  countries: CountryOption[]\n}\n\nexport interface ChannelsResponse {\n  channels: ChannelOption[]\n}\n\n// Simple string types (no longer const literals)\nexport type Genre = string\nexport type Country = string\nexport type YouTubeChannel = string\n```\n\n### 2. Update app/types/index.ts\nRemove or update any references to filter types:\n```typescript\n// Remove these if they exist\n// export type { Genre, Country, YouTubeChannel } from '@/constants/filters'\n\n// Add these\nexport type { \n  Genre, \n  Country, \n  YouTubeChannel,\n  GenreOption,\n  CountryOption,\n  ChannelOption,\n  GenresResponse,\n  CountriesResponse,\n  ChannelsResponse\n} from '~/shared/types/filters'\n```\n\n### 3. Update FilterStore types\nIn `app/stores/useFilterStore.ts`, update FilterState interface if needed:\n```typescript\nexport interface FilterState {\n  // ... other fields ...\n  \n  // These remain as string arrays (no change needed)\n  genres: string[]\n  countries: string[]\n  sources: string[] // channel names\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Search and update type references\nSearch for usage of old types and update:\n```bash\n# Find all references\nrg \"Genre|Country|YouTubeChannel\" --type ts --type vue\n```\n\nUpdate any imports from `@/constants/filters` to use new types from `~/shared/types/filters`.\n\n### 5. Deprecate constants/filters.ts\nAdd deprecation notice at top of file:\n```typescript\n/**\n * @deprecated This file is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\n * Filter options are now loaded dynamically from the database.\n * Use the API endpoints instead:\n * - GET /api/filters/genres\n * - GET /api/filters/countries\n * - GET /api/filters/channels\n * \n * For types, import from ~/shared/types/filters instead.\n */\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n- shared/types/filters.ts (create new)\n- app/types/index.ts (update exports)\n- app/stores/useFilterStore.ts (verify types)\n- app/constants/filters.ts (add deprecation notice)\n\n## Files to Check\nSearch for imports from constants/filters and update if needed:\n- app/components/FilterMenu.vue (already updated in previous task)\n- Any other components using filter types\n\n## Testing\n1. Run `pnpm typecheck` - should pass with no errors\n2. Run `pnpm build` - should succeed\n3. Check that IDE autocomplete still works for filter types\n4.

This becomes the foundation for the entire theme system.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-28T01:11:28.014259234+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-29T13:42:02.979031254+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-29T13:42:02.979031254+01:00"}

{"id":"movies-deluxe-6q7c","title":"Testing: Verify filter migration and regenerate database","description":"# Testing: Verify Filter Migration and Regenerate Database\n\n## Objective\nComprehensive testing of the filter migration to ensure everything works correctly end-to-end.\n\n## Testing Steps\n\n### 1. Regenerate SQLite Database\n```bash\npnpm tsx scripts/generate-sqlite.ts\n```\n\n**Verify**:\n- Script completes without errors\n- Progress messages show genre/country parsing\n- Database file created at public/data/movies.db\n- File size reasonable (\u003c 100MB)\n\n### 2. Verify Database Schema\n```bash\nsqlite3 public/data/movies.db \".schema genres\"\nsqlite3 public/data/movies.db \".schema countries\"\n```\n\n**Verify**:\n- Tables exist with correct schema\n- Indexes created\n\n### 3. Verify Database Data\n```bash\n# Check genres\nsqlite3 public/data/movies.db \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM genres;\"\nsqlite3 public/data/movies.db \"SELECT * FROM genres ORDER BY movie_count DESC LIMIT 10;\"\n\n# Check countries\nsqlite3 public/data/movies.db \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM countries;\"\nsqlite3 public/data/movies.db \"SELECT * FROM countries ORDER BY movie_count DESC LIMIT 10;\"\n\n# Check channels\nsqlite3 public/data/movies.db \"SELECT * FROM channels ORDER BY name;\"\n```\n\n**Verify**:\n- Reasonable number of genres (20-50)\n- Reasonable number of countries (30-80)\n- All channels present\n- Counts look accurate\n- No duplicate entries\n\n### 4. Test API Endpoints\nStart dev server:\n```bash\npnpm dev\n```\n\nTest endpoints:\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:3003/api/filters/genres | jq\ncurl http://localhost:3003/api/filters/countries | jq\ncurl http://localhost:3003/api/filters/channels | jq\n```\n\n**Verify**:\n- All endpoints return 200 OK\n- Response format matches specification\n- Data sorted correctly (by count DESC, name ASC)\n- Counts match database queries\n- Response time \u003c 100ms\n\n### 5. Test Frontend Integration\nOpen browser to http://localhost:3003\n\n**Verify Filter Menu**:\n- [ ] Filter menu opens without errors\n- [ ] Genres section loads and displays with counts\n- [ ] Countries section loads and displays with counts\n- [ ] Channels section loads and displays with counts\n- [ ] Loading states appear briefly during fetch\n- [ ] No console errors\n- [ ] Counts displayed correctly: \"Drama (15234)\"\n\n**Test Filtering**:\n- [ ] Select a genre → movies filter correctly\n- [ ] Select a country → movies filter correctly\n- [ ] Select a channel → movies filter correctly\n- [ ] Select multiple filters → movies filter correctly\n- [ ] Clear filters → all movies shown\n- [ ] Filter counts update correctly\n\n**Test Edge Cases**:\n- [ ] Throttle network (DevTools) → loading states work\n- [ ] Stop server → error state appears\n- [ ] Restart server → retry button works\n- [ ] Refresh page → filters persist (localStorage)\n\n### 6. Performance Testing\nUse browser DevTools Performance tab:\n\n**Measure**:\n- Time to load filter options (should be \u003c 100ms)\n- Time to apply filters (should be \u003c 500ms)\n- Memory usage (should not leak)\n- Network requests (should be cached)\n\n### 7. TypeScript Verification\n```bash\npnpm typecheck\npnpm build\n```\n\n**Verify**:\n- No TypeScript errors\n- Build succeeds\n- No warnings about deprecated types\n\n### 8. Cross-browser Testing\nTest in:\n- [ ] Chrome/Edge (Chromium)\n- [ ] Firefox\n- [ ] Safari (if available)\n\n**Verify**:\n- Filter menu works in all browsers\n- No console errors\n- UI renders correctly\n\n### 9. Mobile Testing\nTest on mobile viewport (DevTools device emulation):\n\n**Verify**:\n- [ ] Filter menu opens on mobile\n- [ ] Filters scrollable\n- [ ] Touch interactions work\n- [ ] No layout issues\n\n## Issues to Look For\n\n1. **Data Quality**:\n   - Missing genres/countries\n   - Duplicate entries\n   - Incorrect counts\n   - USA vs United States inconsistency\n\n2. **Performance**:\n   - Slow API responses (\u003e 100ms)\n   - Slow filtering (\u003e 500ms)\n   - Memory leaks\n   - Excessive re-renders\n\n3. **UI/UX**:\n   - Loading states too fast/slow\n   - Error messages unclear\n   - Counts not aligned\n   - Overflow issues with long names\n\n4. **Functionality**:\n   - Filters not applying correctly\n   - Multiple filters not combining (AND vs OR)\n   - Clear filters not working\n   - Persistence not working\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Database regenerates successfully with new tables\n- [ ] All API endpoints working and performant\n- [ ] Frontend loads filter options dynamically\n- [ ] Filtering functionality unchanged\n- [ ] No TypeScript errors\n- [ ] No console errors\n- [ ] Performance acceptable\n- [ ] Works across browsers\n- [ ] Mobile-friendly\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires all previous tasks to be completed:\n  - movies-deluxe-wagm (database schema)\n  - movies-deluxe-hf4s (API endpoints)\n  - movies-deluxe-xrad (FilterMenu update)\n  - movies-deluxe-3695 (types update)\n\n## Estimated Time\n2-3 hours","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:11:46.905624206+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T04:22:29.060347929+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-27T04:22:29.060347929+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"movies-deluxe-6q7c","depends_on_id":"movies-deluxe-hdxb","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:12:12.768576378+01:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"movies-deluxe-6q7c","depends_on_id":"movies-deluxe-wagm","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:12:19.113351102+01:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"movies-deluxe-6q7c","depends_on_id":"movies-deluxe-xrad","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:12:19.428670813+01:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"movies-deluxe-6q7c","depends_on_id":"movies-deluxe-hf4s","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:12:19.540175885+01:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"movies-deluxe-6q7c","depends_on_id":"movies-deluxe-3695","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:12:19.636123575+01:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

The current design uses the same font size and weight as the filter name, making the counts too prominent.\n\n## Current State\nFilter labels display as: `Drama (15234)`\n- Counts in parentheses with same styling as label\n- Can look cluttered with large numbers\n- Takes up significant visual space\n- May distract from the filter name itself\n\n## Design Goals\n1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Filter name should be primary, count secondary\n2. **Readability**: Counts should be easy to scan but not dominant\n3. **Compact**: Use space efficiently, especially on mobile\n4. **Modern**: Follow contemporary UI patterns for metadata display\n5. **Accessible**: Maintain sufficient contrast and readability\n\n## Design Options to Explore\n\n### Option 1: Smaller, Muted Text (Recommended)\nDisplay count in smaller, lighter text next to label:\n```\nDrama  234\n```\n\n**Implementation**:\n```vue\n\u003ctemplate\u003e\n  \u003clabel class=\"flex items-center justify-between gap-2\"\u003e\n    \u003cspan class=\"flex items-center gap-2\"\u003e\n      \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" /\u003e\n      \u003cspan class=\"font-medium\"\u003eDrama\u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003cspan class=\"text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400\"\u003e234\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003c/label\u003e\n\u003c/template\u003e\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n- Clean, modern look\n- Clear visual hierarchy\n- Easy to scan\n- Space-efficient\n\n**Cons**:\n- Requires layout changes (flexbox)\n\n### Option 2: Badge/Pill Style\nDisplay count in a small badge:\n```\nDrama [234]\n```\n\n**Implementation**:\n```vue\n\u003cspan class=\"inline-flex items-center gap-2\"\u003e\n  \u003cspan\u003eDrama\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003cspan class=\"px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs rounded bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400\"\u003e\n    234\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n- Visually distinct\n- Modern UI pattern\n- Clear separation\n\n**Cons**:\n- Takes more space\n- May look too \"busy\" with many filters\n\n### Option 3: Superscript Style\nDisplay count as superscript:\n```\nDrama²³⁴\n```\n\n**Implementation**:\n```vue\n\u003cspan\u003e\n  Drama\n  \u003csup class=\"text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 ml-0.5\"\u003e234\u003c/sup\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n- Very compact\n- Subtle\n- Doesn't break layout\n\n**Cons**:\n- May be hard to read\n- Unusual pattern for this use case\n\n### Option 4: Abbreviated Numbers\nFormat large numbers with abbreviations:\n```\nDrama (15K)\nComedy (12K)\nAction (8.5K)\n```\n\n**Implementation**:\n```typescript\nfunction formatCount(count: number): string {\n  if (count \u003e= 1000000) {\n    return `${(count / 1000000).toFixed(1)}M`\n  }\n  if (count \u003e= 1000) {\n    return `${(count / 1000).toFixed(count \u003e= 10000 ? 0 : 1)}K`\n  }\n  return count.toString()\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n- Very compact\n- Easy to scan\n- Common pattern (GitHub, Twitter, etc.)\n\n**Cons**:\n- Less precise\n- May need tooltip for exact count\n\n### Option 5: Tooltip on Hover\nShow count only on hover/focus:\n```\nDrama  [hover: 15,234 movies]\n```\n\n**Implementation**:\n```vue\n\u003clabel class=\"group relative\"\u003e\n  \u003cspan\u003eDrama\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003cspan class=\"absolute left-full ml-2 px-2 py-1 text-xs bg-gray-900 text-white rounded opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity whitespace-nowrap\"\u003e\n    15,234 movies\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/label\u003e\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n- Very clean default state\n- Progressive disclosure\n- Exact count available\n\n**Cons**:\n- Not discoverable\n- Not accessible on mobile\n- Hides useful information\n\n### Option 6: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)\nCombine multiple techniques:\n- Small, muted text for counts\n- Abbreviated for large numbers (\u003e1000)\n- Tooltip with exact count on hover\n- Right-aligned for clean layout\n\n```vue\n\u003clabel class=\"flex items-center justify-between gap-2 group\"\u003e\n  \u003cspan class=\"flex items-center gap-2\"\u003e\n    \u003cinput type=\"checkbox\" /\u003e\n    \u003cspan class=\"font-medium\"\u003eDrama\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003cspan \n    class=\"text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 tabindex=\"0\"\n    :title=\"`${genre.count.toLocaleString()} movies`\"\n  \u003e\n    {{ formatCount(genre.count) }}\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/label\u003e\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n- Best of multiple approaches\n- Clean and compact\n- Accessible (title attribute)\n- Professional look\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1.

Try badge style (Option 2) for more visual separation\n2. Consider removing counts entirely if they're not useful\n3. Show counts only for selected filters\n4. Use color coding instead of numbers (e.g., dot size)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Should be implemented after movies-deluxe-xrad (FilterMenu API integration)\n- Can be done independently if counts are already displayed\n\n## Estimated Time\n1-2 hours\n\n## References\n- GitHub's repository stats display\n- Twitter's follower count formatting\n- Material Design number formatting guidelines\n- WCAG 2.1 contrast requirements","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:31:38.846743001+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T04:42:48.959728183+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-27T04:42:48.959728183+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"movies-deluxe-9oz6","depends_on_id":"movies-deluxe-hdxb","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:31:44.790418135+01:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"movies-deluxe-9oz6","depends_on_id":"movies-deluxe-xrad","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:31:44.88410721+01:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"movies-deluxe-c2fm","title":"Virtual scroll: Show placeholder cards with title only, then lazy load full cards with debounce","description":"# Virtual Scroll: Show Placeholder Cards with Title Only, Then Lazy Load Full Cards with Debounce\n\n## Problem\nThe virtual scroll currently loads full movie cards immediately for all visible items. This can cause performance issues when:\n- Scrolling quickly through the list\n- Many cards are rendered at once\n- Images and full card content load simultaneously\n- Unnecessary rendering happens for cards that are scrolled past quickly\n\n## Goal\nOptimize virtual scroll performance by showing lightweight placeholder cards initially (with just the title), then lazy loading the full card content with debounce to prevent excessive rendering.\n\n## Current Behavior\n`MovieVirtualGrid.vue` renders full `MovieCard` components immediately for all visible items in the virtual scroll viewport.\n\n## Proposed Behavior\n\n### Phase 1: Initial Render (Immediate)\nShow a lightweight placeholder card with:\n- **Title only** (available in movie data)\n- Simple background color\n- Minimal styling\n- No poster image\n- No metadata (year, rating, votes, etc.)\n\n### Phase 2: Full Card Load (Debounced)\nAfter a short debounce delay (e.g., 150-300ms):\n- Replace placeholder with full `MovieCard` component\n- Load poster image\n- Show all metadata\n- Apply full styling\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n### 1. Check Available Data\nFirst, verify that movie title is available in the initial data structure:\n```typescript\n// Check what's available in the movie object\n// app/stores/useMovieStore.ts or app/types/movie.ts\ninterface MovieEntry {\n  id: string\n  title: string  // ✅ Should be available\n  // ... other fields\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Create Placeholder Component\nCreate `app/components/MovieCardPlaceholder.vue`:\n```vue\n\u003ctemplate\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"block border rounded-xl overflow-hidden bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900/30 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800\"\u003e\n    \u003c!-- Placeholder for poster (empty) --\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"aspect-[2/3] bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-800\" /\u003e\n    \n    \u003c!-- Title only --\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"p-3\"\u003e\n      \u003ch3 class=\"text-sm font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-white line-clamp-2\"\u003e\n        {{ title }}\n      \u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/template\u003e\n\n\u003cscript setup lang=\"ts\"\u003e\ninterface Props {\n  title: string\n}\n\ndefineProps\u003cProps\u003e()\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\n### 3. Update MovieVirtualGrid Component\nModify `app/components/MovieVirtualGrid.vue`:\n\n```vue\n\u003cscript setup lang=\"ts\"\u003e\nimport { useVirtualList } from '@vueuse/core'\n\n// Track which cards should show full content\nconst loadedCards = ref\u003cSet\u003cstring\u003e\u003e(new Set())\nconst loadQueue = ref\u003cMap\u003cstring, number\u003e\u003e(new Map())\n\nconst DEBOUNCE_DELAY = 200 // ms\n\n// Debounced function to load full card\nconst scheduleCardLoad = (movieId: string) =\u003e {\n  // Clear existing timeout if any\n  if (loadQueue.value.has(movieId)) {\n    clearTimeout(loadQueue.value.get(movieId))\n  }\n  \n  // Schedule new load\n  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() =\u003e {\n    loadedCards.value.add(movieId)\n    loadQueue.value.delete(movieId)\n  }, DEBOUNCE_DELAY)\n  \n  loadQueue.value.set(movieId, timeoutId)\n}\n\n// When items become visible, schedule their load\nwatchEffect(() =\u003e {\n  list.value.forEach(item =\u003e {\n    if (!loadedCards.value.has(item.data.id)) {\n      scheduleCardLoad(item.data.id)\n    }\n  })\n})\n\n// Cleanup timeouts on unmount\nonUnmounted(() =\u003e {\n  loadQueue.value.forEach(timeoutId =\u003e clearTimeout(timeoutId))\n})\n\u003c/script\u003e\n\n\u003ctemplate\u003e\n  \u003cdiv ref=\"containerRef\" class=\"...\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\n      v-for=\"item in list\"\n      :key=\"item.data.id\"\n      :style=\"{ height: itemHeight + 'px' }\"\n    \u003e\n      \u003c!-- Show placeholder or full card --\u003e\n      \u003cMovieCardPlaceholder\n        v-if=\"!loadedCards.has(item.data.id)\"\n        :title=\"item.data.title\"\n      /\u003e\n      \u003cMovieCard\n        v-else\n        :movie=\"item.data\"\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/template\u003e\n```\n\n### 4. Alternative: Use Intersection Observer\nFor more precise control, use Intersection Observer instead of debounce:\n\n```typescript\nconst observer = new IntersectionObserver(\n  (entries) =\u003e {\n    entries.forEach(entry =\u003e {\n      if (entry.isIntersecting) {\n        const movieId = entry.target.dataset.movieId\n        // Load after card has been visible for 150ms\n        setTimeout(() =\u003e {\n          if (entry.isIntersecting) {\n            loadedCards.value.add(movieId)\n          }\n        }, 150)\n      }\n    })\n  },\n  { threshold: 0.1 }\n)\n```\n\n## Design Considerations\n\n### Placeholder Styling\n- Keep it minimal and lightweight\n- Use solid colors (no gradients or complex styles)\n- Match the aspect ratio of full cards\n- Show title for context\n- Optional: Add subtle \"loading\" indicator\n\n### Debounce Timing\n- **Too short (\u003c 100ms)**: Defeats the purpose, loads too quickly\n- **Too long (\u003e 500ms)**: Feels sluggish, poor UX\n- **Recommended**: 150-300ms\n- Consider making it configurable\n\n### User Experience\n- Placeholder should be visually distinct but not jarring\n- Transition from placeholder to full card should be smooth\n- Consider fade-in animation when full card loads\n- Ensure title is readable and properly truncated\n\n## Performance Benefits\n\n### Expected Improvements\n- **Faster initial render**: Lightweight placeholders render instantly\n- **Reduced memory**: Fewer full components in memory at once\n- **Smoother scrolling**: Less work during rapid scroll\n- **Better perceived performance**: Content appears faster (title shows immediately)\n\n### Metrics to Track\n- Time to first render\n- Scroll FPS (frames per second)\n- Memory usage during scroll\n- Number of full cards rendered vs visible\n\n## Testing Checklist\n\n### Functionality\n- [ ] Placeholders show immediately with correct title\n- [ ] Full cards load after debounce delay\n- [ ] Scrolling quickly doesn't trigger excessive loads\n- [ ] Scrolling slowly loads cards smoothly\n- [ ] No memory leaks (timeouts cleaned up)\n- [ ] Works with search/filter changes\n\n### Performance\n- [ ] Measure scroll FPS before/after\n- [ ] Check memory usage during rapid scroll\n- [ ] Verify fewer components rendered during scroll\n- [ ] Test with large dataset (1000+ movies)\n\n### Visual\n- [ ] Placeholder styling looks good\n- [ ] Transition to full card is smooth\n- [ ] No layout shift when card loads\n- [ ] Works in light and dark mode\n- [ ] Responsive on all screen sizes\n\n### Edge Cases\n- [ ] Rapid filter changes\n- [ ] Scroll to bottom quickly\n- [ ] Scroll up and down repeatedly\n- [ ] Component unmount during load\n- [ ] Very fast scrolling\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n### New Files\n- `app/components/MovieCardPlaceholder.vue` - Lightweight placeholder component\n\n### Modified Files\n- `app/components/MovieVirtualGrid.vue` - Add debounced loading logic\n- `app/types/movie.ts` - Verify title is available in movie data (check only)\n\n## Configuration Options\n\nConsider making these configurable:\n```typescript\ninterface VirtualScrollConfig {\n  debounceDelay: number        // Default: 200ms\n  useIntersectionObserver: boolean  // Default: false\n  placeholderFadeIn: boolean   // Default: true\n  preloadCount: number         // Preload N cards ahead\n}\n```\n\n## Alternative Approaches\n\n### Option 1: Debounce (Recommended)\n- Simple to implement\n- Works well for most cases\n- Easy to tune delay\n\n### Option 2: Intersection Observer\n- More precise control\n- Better for complex scenarios\n- Slightly more complex code\n\n### Option 3: Hybrid\n- Use placeholder for initial render\n- Use Intersection Observer for visibility detection\n- Debounce the actual load\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Placeholders render immediately with title\n- [ ] Full cards load after configurable debounce\n- [ ] Scrolling feels smoother and more responsive\n- [ ] No visual regressions\n- [ ] Performance metrics show improvement\n- [ ] Code is maintainable and well-documented\n\n## Priority\n**P2 (Medium)** - Performance optimization that improves UX, especially for users with large movie collections or slower devices.\n\n## Estimated Time\n3-4 hours\n\n## Notes\n- Title should definitely be available in movie data (verify first)\n- Consider A/B testing different debounce delays\n- May want to make this behavior optional via user preference\n- Could extend to other virtual scroll scenarios in the app\n- Consider preloading cards slightly ahead of viewport for smoother experience","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T05:17:44.087685238+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T05:21:56.044979449+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-27T05:21:56.044979449+01:00"}

This includes genres, countries, and YouTube channels. The data should be extracted from actual movie entries and channels table, ensuring the UI only shows filters that have actual data.\n\n## Current State\n- Genres, countries, and YouTube channels are hardcoded in `app/constants/filters.ts`\n- FilterMenu.vue imports these constants directly\n- No guarantee that hardcoded values match actual data in database\n- Adding new channels requires updating both config/youtube-channels.json AND app/constants/filters.ts\n\n## Goals\n1. **Single Source of Truth**: Database becomes the authoritative source for all filter options\n2. **Dynamic Data**: Filters reflect actual data in the database (no empty filters)\n3. **Maintainability**: Adding new channels only requires updating config/youtube-channels.json\n4. **Performance**: Efficient queries with proper indexing\n5. **Type Safety**: Maintain TypeScript types for filter options\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Database Schema Changes\nCreate new tables for normalized filter data:\n- \\`genres\\` table: id, name, movie_count (for sorting by popularity)\n- \\`countries\\` table: id, name, movie_count (for sorting by popularity)\n- Use existing \\`channels\\` table (already has id, name, created_at)\n\n### Data Extraction\nParse comma-separated genre/country strings from movies table:\n- \"Comedy, Sci-Fi\" → [\"Comedy\", \"Sci-Fi\"]\n- \"United States, United Kingdom\" → [\"United States\", \"United Kingdom\"]\n- Count occurrences for movie_count\n- Store unique values in new tables\n\n### API Endpoints\nCreate new endpoints to fetch filter options:\n- GET /api/filters/genres - Returns all genres with counts\n- GET /api/filters/countries - Returns all countries with counts  \n- GET /api/filters/channels - Returns all channels from channels table\n\n### Frontend Changes\n- Update FilterMenu.vue to fetch filter options from API on mount\n- Add loading states for filter options\n- Update useFilterStore to cache filter options\n- Remove dependency on @/constants/filters.ts\n- Keep TypeScript types but make them dynamic (string instead of const)\n\n### Migration Strategy\n1. Create new schema and populate tables\n2. Create API endpoints\n3. Update frontend to use API\n4. Deprecate constants file (keep for reference initially)\n5. Update all imports and type references\n\n## Benefits\n- ✅ Filters always match actual data\n- ✅ No orphaned filter options\n- ✅ Easier maintenance (one place to update)\n- ✅ Better UX (show counts next to filters)\n- ✅ Scalable (handles new channels automatically)\n\n## Files Affected\n- scripts/generate-sqlite.ts (schema + data population)\n- server/api/filters/*.get.ts (new API endpoints)\n- app/components/FilterMenu.vue (fetch from API)\n- app/stores/useFilterStore.ts (cache filter options)\n- app/constants/filters.ts (deprecate)\n- app/types/index.ts (update types)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Database contains genres, countries, channels tables with accurate data\n- [ ] API endpoints return filter options with counts\n- [ ] FilterMenu loads options dynamically from API\n- [ ] No references to @/constants/filters remain in active code\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds with updated types\n- [ ] Filter UI shows counts next to each option\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable (\u003c 100ms for filter options query)","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:10:15.102642013+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T04:23:15.141374286+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-27T04:23:15.141374286+01:00"}

GET /api/filters/countries\n**File**: `server/api/filters/countries.get.ts`\n\nReturns all countries sorted by movie count (most popular first).\n\n```typescript\nexport default defineEventHandler(async () =\u003e {\n  const db = await loadMoviesDatabase()\n  \n  // Query countries from SQLite\n  const countries = await db.query(`\n    SELECT name, movie_count\n    FROM countries\n    ORDER BY movie_count DESC, name ASC\n  `)\n  \n  return {\n    countries: countries.map(c =\u003e ({\n      name: c.name,\n      count: c.movie_count\n    }))\n  }\n})\n```\n\n**Response format**:\n```json\n{\n  \"countries\": [\n    { \"name\": \"United States\", \"count\": 25678 },\n    { \"name\": \"United Kingdom\", \"count\": 8234 },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### 3. GET /api/filters/channels\n**File**: `server/api/filters/channels.get.ts`\n\nReturns all YouTube channels sorted by name.\n\n```typescript\nexport default defineEventHandler(async () =\u003e {\n  const db = await loadMoviesDatabase()\n  \n  // Query channels from SQLite\n  const channels = await db.query(`\n    SELECT c.id, c.name, COUNT(s.id) as movie_count\n    FROM channels c\n    LEFT JOIN sources s ON s.channelId = c.id\n    GROUP BY c.id, c.name\n    ORDER BY c.name ASC\n  `)\n  \n  return {\n    channels: channels.map(ch =\u003e ({\n      id: ch.id,\n      name: ch.name,\n      count: ch.movie_count\n    }))\n  }\n})\n```\n\n**Response format**:\n```json\n{\n  \"channels\": [\n    { \"id\": \"UC...\", \"name\": \"FilmRise Movies\", \"count\": 3456 },\n    { \"id\": \"UC...\", \"name\": \"Mosfilm\", \"count\": 1234 },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n1. **Use existing database utilities**:\n   - Import from `server/utils/movieData.ts`\n   - Use `loadMoviesDatabase()` or create new utility for SQLite queries\n\n2. **Error handling**:\n   - Wrap queries in try-catch\n   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes\n   - Log errors using server logger\n\n3. **Caching** (optional for now):\n   - Consider adding cache headers (Cache-Control: max-age=3600)\n   - Data changes infrequently (only when database regenerates)\n\n4. **TypeScript types**:\n   - Create shared types for API responses\n   - Export from `shared/types/` for use in frontend\n\n## Files to Create\n- server/api/filters/genres.get.ts\n- server/api/filters/countries.get.ts\n- server/api/filters/channels.get.ts\n- shared/types/filters.ts (optional, for response types)\n\n## Testing\n1. Start dev server: `pnpm dev`\n2. Test endpoints:\n   ```bash\n   curl http://localhost:3003/api/filters/genres\n   curl http://localhost:3003/api/filters/countries\n   curl http://localhost:3003/api/filters/channels\n   ```\n3. Verify response format matches specification\n4. Check performance (should be \u003c 100ms)\n5. Test error handling (rename database file temporarily)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] All three endpoints created and working\n- [ ] Responses match specified format\n- [ ] Data sorted correctly (by count DESC, then name ASC)\n- [ ] Error handling implemented\n- [ ] TypeScript types defined\n- [ ] Performance acceptable (\u003c 100ms per request)\n- [ ] No console errors in server logs\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires database schema task (movies-deluxe-wagm) to be completed first\n\n## Estimated Time\n1-2 hours","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:10:53.451836542+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T04:16:35.129252208+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-27T04:16:35.129252208+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"movies-deluxe-hf4s","depends_on_id":"movies-deluxe-hdxb","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:12:12.52982084+01:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"movies-deluxe-hf4s","depends_on_id":"movies-deluxe-wagm","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:12:19.033547547+01:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Add Deprecation Notice\nUpdate `app/constants/filters.ts`:\n\n```typescript\n/**\n * @deprecated This file is deprecated and will be removed in v2.0.0\n * \n * Filter options are now loaded dynamically from the SQLite database.\n * This ensures filters always match actual data and eliminates maintenance overhead.\n * \n * ## Migration Guide\n * \n * ### For API consumers:\n * Use the new API endpoints:\n * - GET /api/filters/genres - Returns all genres with counts\n * - GET /api/filters/countries - Returns all countries with counts\n * - GET /api/filters/channels - Returns all channels with counts\n * \n * ### For TypeScript types:\n * Import from shared types instead:\n * ```typescript\n * // Old (deprecated)\n * import type { Genre, Country, YouTubeChannel } from '@/constants/filters'\n * \n * // New (recommended)\n * import type { Genre, Country, YouTubeChannel } from '~/shared/types/filters'\n * ```\n * \n * ### For components:\n * Fetch filter options dynamically:\n * ```typescript\n * const { data: genres } = await useFetch('/api/filters/genres')\n * const { data: countries } = await useFetch('/api/filters/countries')\n * const { data: channels } = await useFetch('/api/filters/channels')\n * ```\n * \n * See FilterMenu.vue for a complete example.\n */\n\n// Keep exports for backward compatibility (will be removed in v2.0.0)\nexport const YOUTUBE_CHANNELS = [\n  'FilmRise Movies',\n  'Mosfilm',\n  'Movie Central',\n  'Moviedome',\n  'Netzkino',\n  'Popcornflix',\n  'Timeless Classic Movies',\n] as const\n\nexport const AVAILABLE_GENRES = [\n  'Action',\n  'Adventure',\n  // ... rest of genres\n] as const\n\nexport const AVAILABLE_COUNTRIES = [\n  'Australia',\n  'Belgium',\n  // ... rest of countries\n] as const\n\nexport type YouTubeChannel = (typeof YOUTUBE_CHANNELS)[number]\nexport type Genre = (typeof AVAILABLE_GENRES)[number]\nexport type Country = (typeof AVAILABLE_COUNTRIES)[number]\n```\n\n### 2. Verify No Active Imports\nSearch for any remaining imports:\n```bash\nrg \"from '@/constants/filters'\" --type ts --type vue\nrg \"from '~/constants/filters'\" --type ts --type vue\nrg \"from '@/app/constants/filters'\" --type ts --type vue\n```\n\n**Expected**: Only the deprecation notice file itself should appear.\n\nIf any imports found:\n- Update to use new API endpoints or types\n- Document in issue comments\n\n### 3. Update Documentation\nIf README.md or other docs mention constants/filters.ts:\n- Update to reference new API endpoints\n- Add migration guide section\n- Update architecture diagrams if any\n\n### 4. Add ESLint Rule (Optional)\nAdd rule to warn about deprecated imports:\n```javascript\n// eslint.config.ts\n{\n  rules: {\n    'no-restricted-imports': [\n      'warn',\n      {\n        paths: [\n          {\n            name: '@/constants/filters',\n            message: 'This module is deprecated. Use /api/filters/* endpoints instead.'\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Plan for Future Removal\nCreate a follow-up issue for v2.0.0:\n- Title: \"Remove deprecated constants/filters.ts\"\n- Milestone: v2.0.0\n- Description: \"Remove the deprecated constants/filters.ts file after all consumers have migrated to the new API endpoints.\"\n\n## Files to Modify\n- app/constants/filters.ts (add deprecation notice)\n- README.md (update if needed)\n- eslint.config.ts (optional rule)\n\n## Testing\n1. Run `pnpm typecheck` - should pass\n2. Run `pnpm build` - should succeed\n3. Search for imports - should find none (except in tests)\n4. Verify deprecation notice visible in IDE\n5. Check that old code still works (backward compatibility)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Deprecation notice added with clear migration guide\n- [ ] No active imports of deprecated file (except backward compat)\n- [ ] Documentation updated\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds\n- [ ] Build succeeds\n- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained\n- [ ] ESLint rule added (optional)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires testing task (movies-deluxe-6q7c) to be completed and passing\n- Should be last task in epic\n\n## Estimated Time\n30 minutes - 1 hour","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:12:06.807127262+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T04:23:15.043899352+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-27T04:23:15.043899352+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"movies-deluxe-itxy","depends_on_id":"movies-deluxe-hdxb","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:12:12.834935061+01:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"movies-deluxe-itxy","depends_on_id":"movies-deluxe-6q7c","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:12:19.746137705+01:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"movies-deluxe-lkxk","title":"Mobile: Add accordion behavior to filter/sort menu sections","description":"# Mobile: Add Accordion Behavior to Filter/Sort Menu Sections\n\n## Problem\nOn mobile devices, the filter menu shows all sections expanded at once, making it difficult to navigate and requiring excessive scrolling. Users need to scroll through all filter options to reach the sections they want.\n\n## Goal\nImplement accordion-style collapsible sections in the FilterMenu component for mobile devices, allowing users to expand/collapse individual filter sections (Sort By, Rating, Year, Votes, Source, Genres, Countries) with smooth slide animations.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Behavior\n- **Mobile only**: Accordion behavior should only apply on mobile (\u003c md breakpoint)\n- **Desktop unchanged**: Desktop should keep all sections expanded as they are now\n- **Single/Multiple open**: Allow multiple sections to be open at once (not exclusive accordion)\n- **Default state**: All sections collapsed by default on mobile, or keep Sort By expanded\n- **Smooth animations**: Slide down/up animations when expanding/collapsing\n- **Persist state**: Optional - remember which sections are open in session storage\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n#### CSS-Only Solution (Preferred)\nUse UnoCSS utilities and CSS animations only, no JavaScript state management:\n\n1. **HTML Structure**:\n   - Wrap each FilterSection content in a collapsible container\n   - Use checkbox hack or details/summary elements for pure CSS solution\n   - Add click handler to section headers on mobile\n\n2. **UnoCSS Classes**:\n   - `max-h-0 overflow-hidden` for collapsed state\n   - `max-h-screen` or `max-h-[2000px]` for expanded state\n   - `transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out` for smooth animation\n   - `md:max-h-none` to disable on desktop\n\n3. **Animation**:\n   - Use CSS transitions on max-height for slide effect\n   - Add rotation animation to chevron icon (0deg → 180deg)\n   - Optional: Use CSS custom properties for dynamic heights\n\n#### Example Structure\n\n```vue\n\u003ctemplate\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"filter-section\"\u003e\n    \u003c!-- Header (clickable on mobile) --\u003e\n    \u003cbutton \n      class=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full p-4 md:cursor-default\"\n      @click=\"toggleSection\"\n    \u003e\n      \u003cdiv class=\"flex items-center gap-2\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv :class=\"iconClass\" /\u003e\n        \u003ch3\u003e{{ title }}\u003c/h3\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003c!-- Chevron (mobile only) --\u003e\n      \u003cdiv \n        class=\"i-mdi-chevron-down text-xl transition-transform duration-300 md:hidden\"\n        :class=\"{ 'rotate-180': isExpanded }\"\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/button\u003e\n    \n    \u003c!-- Content (collapsible on mobile) --\u003e\n    \u003cdiv \n      :class=\"[\n        'transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out overflow-hidden',\n        'md:max-h-none', // Always expanded on desktop\n        isExpanded ?

{"id":"movies-deluxe-vjjr","title":"Test and optimize related movies performance","description":"Comprehensive testing and performance optimization of the related movies feature.\n\n## Testing Checklist\n\n### 1. Database Generation\n- [ ] Run `pnpm tsx scripts/generate-sqlite.ts`\n- [ ] Verify completion without errors\n- [ ] Check generation time (should be \u003c 15 minutes)\n- [ ] Verify database size (should not increase significantly)\n\n### 2. Database Verification\n```bash\n# Check table exists\nsqlite3 public/data/movies.db '.schema related_movies'\n\n# Check row count\nsqlite3 public/data/movies.db 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM related_movies;'\n\n# Check sample data\nsqlite3 public/data/movies.db 'SELECT * FROM related_movies WHERE movieId = \"tt0068646\" LIMIT 10;'\n\n# Check score distribution\nsqlite3 public/data/movies.db 'SELECT MIN(score), MAX(score), AVG(score) FROM related_movies;'\n\n# Check movies with no related movies\nsqlite3 public/data/movies.db 'SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT imdbId) FROM movies WHERE imdbId NOT IN (SELECT movieId FROM related_movies);'\n```\n\n### 3. Frontend Testing\n- [ ] Navigate to movie detail page\n- [ ] Verify related movies load instantly\n- [ ] Check console for errors\n- [ ] Test with curated movies (should have many related)\n- [ ] Test with non-curated movies (should have few/none)\n- [ ] Test with movies without metadata\n- [ ] Verify MovieCard components render correctly\n- [ ] Test horizontal scroll behavior\n\n### 4. Performance Testing\n```typescript\n// In browser console\nconsole.time('related-movies')\nconst related = await movieStore.getRelatedMovies('tt0068646')\nconsole.timeEnd('related-movies')\n// Should be \u003c 100ms\n```\n\n### 5. Edge Cases\n- [ ] Movie with no related movies (empty array)\n- [ ] Movie that doesn't exist (graceful error)\n- [ ] Movie with only 1-2 related movies\n- [ ] Movie with maximum related movies (8)\n\n## Optimization Opportunities\n\n### If Performance is Slow\n\n1. **Add Covering Index**\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX idx_related_movies_covering \nON related_movies(movieId, score DESC, relatedMovieId);\n```\n\n2. **Denormalize Movie Data**\nStore title/year in related_movies table to avoid JOIN:\n```sql\nALTER TABLE related_movies ADD COLUMN title TEXT;\nALTER TABLE related_movies ADD COLUMN year INTEGER;\n```\n\n3. **Limit Related Movies**\nReduce from 8 to 6 or 4 if database size is a concern.\n\n4. **Parallel Processing**\nUse worker threads during generation:\n```typescript\nimport { Worker } from 'worker_threads'\n// Batch movies across CPU cores\n```\n\n### If Database Size is Too Large\n\n1. **Store Only Top Scores**\nOnly store relationships with score \u003e threshold (e.g., \u003e 10)\n\n2. **Compress Scores**\nUse TINYINT (0-255) instead of INTEGER\n\n3. **Limit Relationships**\nStore max 6 related movies per movie instead of 8\n\n## Success Criteria\n- ✅ Related movies load in \u003c 100ms\n- ✅ Database generation completes in \u003c 15 minutes\n- ✅ Database size increase \u003c 10MB\n- ✅ No console errors\n- ✅ All edge cases handled gracefully\n- ✅ UI matches previous behavior\n\n## Files to Check\n- public/data/movies.db (verify size)\n- Browser DevTools Network tab (verify no extra requests)\n- Browser DevTools Console (verify no errors)\n\n## Rollback Plan\nIf issues arise:\n1.

Run `pnpm tsx scripts/generate-sqlite.ts`\n2. Verify tables exist: `sqlite3 public/data/movies.db \".tables\"`\n3. Check data: `SELECT * FROM genres ORDER BY movie_count DESC LIMIT 10;`\n4. Check data: `SELECT * FROM countries ORDER BY movie_count DESC LIMIT 10;`\n5. Verify counts match expectations from research task\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] genres table created with correct schema\n- [ ] countries table created with correct schema\n- [ ] Indexes created for performance\n- [ ] Data populated with accurate counts\n- [ ] No duplicate entries (UNIQUE constraint works)\n- [ ] Script runs without errors\n- [ ] Database file size reasonable (\u003c 100MB)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires research task (movies-deluxe-46vq) to be completed first\n\n## Estimated Time\n1-2 hours","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:10:38.795465236+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T04:15:29.264504367+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-27T04:15:29.264504367+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"movies-deluxe-wagm","depends_on_id":"movies-deluxe-hdxb","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:12:12.455015629+01:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"movies-deluxe-wagm","depends_on_id":"movies-deluxe-46vq","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T04:12:19.837202945+01:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

This causes the API to include failed posters in the initial filtered list, then skip them during download, so the limit is never reached with actual downloads.\n\n## Problem\n1. download.post.ts filters movies (lines 24-42): has metadata, has poster URL, doesn't exist locally\n2. Takes first N movies based on limit (line 44)\n3. Calls downloadPoster() which THEN checks failed list and skips (lines 116-122)\n4. Result: If first 50 movies include 40 previously failed ones, only 10 actually download\n\n## Solution (Functional Style)\nRefactor to filter failed posters BEFORE limiting, using functional composition:\n\n### In download.post.ts:\n```typescript\n// Load failed posters once at the start\nconst failedPosters = force ? new Set\u003cstring\u003e() : loadFailedPosterIds()\n\n// Filter pipeline (functional composition)\nconst toProcess = entries\n  .filter(movie =\u003e movie.metadata) // Has OMDB metadata\n  .filter(movie =\u003e {\n    const posterUrl = movie.metadata!.Poster\n    return posterUrl \u0026\u0026 posterUrl !== 'N/A' // Valid poster URL\n  })\n  .filter(movie =\u003e {\n    if (force) return true\n    const filepath = join(postersDir, `${movie.imdbId}.jpg`)\n    return !existsSync(filepath) // Not already downloaded\n  })\n  .filter(movie =\u003e !failedPosters.has(movie.imdbId)) // Not previously failed\n  .slice(0, limit) // Take only limit items\n\n// Now toProcess.length === actual downloads (no skips)\n```\n\n### In posterDownloader.ts:\n```typescript\n// Export function to get failed poster IDs\nexport function loadFailedPosterIds(): Set\u003cstring\u003e {\n  try {\n    if (fs.existsSync(FAILED_DOWNLOADS_FILE)) {\n      const data = fs.readFileSync(FAILED_DOWNLOADS_FILE, 'utf-8')\n      const failed: FailedDownload[] = JSON.parse(data)\n      return new Set(failed.map(f =\u003e f.imdbId))\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Failed to load failed downloads:', error)\n  }\n  return new Set()\n}\n```\n\n### Remove duplicate check in downloadPoster:\nRemove lines 116-122 since filtering now happens before calling downloadPoster\n\n## Benefits\n- ✅ Functional style: clear filter pipeline\n- ✅ Efficient: filter once, not per-download\n- ✅ Predictable: limit === actual downloads\n- ✅ No duplicate skip logic\n- ✅ Better progress reporting (accurate total)\n\n## Files to Modify\n- server/api/admin/posters/download.post.ts (lines 6-48)\n- server/utils/posterDownloader.ts (export loadFailedPosterIds, remove skip logic)\n\n## Testing\n1. Add some failed posters to public/data/failed-posters.json\n2. Run poster download with limit=10\n3. Verify exactly 10 posters download (not fewer due to skips)\n4.

Remove constant imports\nRemove this line from FilterMenu.vue:\n```typescript\nimport { YOUTUBE_CHANNELS, AVAILABLE_GENRES, AVAILABLE_COUNTRIES } from '@/constants/filters'\n```\n\n### 2. Add reactive state for filter options\n```typescript\nconst genres = ref\u003cArray\u003c{ name: string; count: number }\u003e\u003e([])\nconst countries = ref\u003cArray\u003c{ name: string; count: number }\u003e\u003e([])\nconst channels = ref\u003cArray\u003c{ id: string; name: string; count: number }\u003e\u003e([])\nconst isLoadingFilters = ref(true)\nconst filterLoadError = ref\u003cstring | null\u003e(null)\n```\n\n### 3. Create fetch function\n```typescript\nconst fetchFilterOptions = async () =\u003e {\n  isLoadingFilters.value = true\n  filterLoadError.value = null\n  \n  try {\n    const [genresRes, countriesRes, channelsRes] = await Promise.all([\n      $fetch('/api/filters/genres'),\n      $fetch('/api/filters/countries'),\n      $fetch('/api/filters/channels')\n    ])\n    \n    genres.value = genresRes.genres\n    countries.value = countriesRes.countries\n    channels.value = channelsRes.channels\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Failed to load filter options:', error)\n    filterLoadError.value = 'Failed to load filter options'\n  } finally {\n    isLoadingFilters.value = false\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Fetch on mount\n```typescript\nonMounted(() =\u003e {\n  isDev.value = isLocalhost()\n  fetchFilterOptions()\n})\n```\n\n### 5. Update template to use dynamic data\n\n**Replace genre section**:\n```vue\n\u003c!-- Before --\u003e\n\u003cAppInputCheckbox\n  v-for=\"genre in availableGenres\"\n  :key=\"genre\"\n  :label=\"genre\"\n  :checked=\"filters.genres.includes(genre)\"\n  @change=\"toggleGenre(genre)\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- After --\u003e\n\u003cdiv v-if=\"isLoadingFilters\" class=\"text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400\"\u003e\n  Loading genres...\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cAppInputCheckbox\n  v-else\n  v-for=\"genre in genres\"\n  :key=\"genre.name\"\n  :label=\"`${genre.name} (${genre.count})`\"\n  :checked=\"filters.genres.includes(genre.name)\"\n  @change=\"toggleGenre(genre.name)\"\n/\u003e\n```\n\n**Replace country section**:\n```vue\n\u003c!-- Before --\u003e\n\u003cAppInputCheckbox\n  v-for=\"country in availableCountries\"\n  :key=\"country\"\n  :label=\"country\"\n  :checked=\"filters.countries.includes(country)\"\n  @change=\"toggleCountry(country)\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- After --\u003e\n\u003cdiv v-if=\"isLoadingFilters\" class=\"text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400\"\u003e\n  Loading countries...\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cAppInputCheckbox\n  v-else\n  v-for=\"country in countries\"\n  :key=\"country.name\"\n  :label=\"`${country.name} (${country.count})`\"\n  :checked=\"filters.countries.includes(country.name)\"\n  @change=\"toggleCountry(country.name)\"\n/\u003e\n```\n\n**Replace channel section**:\n```vue\n\u003c!-- Before --\u003e\n\u003cAppInputCheckbox\n  v-for=\"channel in youtubeChannels\"\n  :key=\"channel\"\n  :label=\"channel\"\n  :checked=\"filters.sources.includes(channel)\"\n  @change=\"toggleSource(channel)\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- After --\u003e\n\u003cdiv v-if=\"isLoadingFilters\" class=\"text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400\"\u003e\n  Loading channels...\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cAppInputCheckbox\n  v-else\n  v-for=\"channel in channels\"\n  :key=\"channel.id\"\n  :label=\"`${channel.name} (${channel.count})`\"\n  :checked=\"filters.sources.includes(channel.name)\"\n  @change=\"toggleSource(channel.name)\"\n/\u003e\n```\n\n### 6. Add error state to template\n```vue\n\u003cdiv v-if=\"filterLoadError\" class=\"text-sm text-red-500 dark:text-red-400 p-4\"\u003e\n  {{ filterLoadError }}\n  \u003cbutton @click=\"fetchFilterOptions\" class=\"underline ml-2\"\u003eRetry\u003c/button\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n## UI Improvements\n\n1. **Show counts next to filter names**: `Drama (15234)`\n2. **Loading states**: Show \"Loading...\" while fetching\n3. **Error handling**: Show error message with retry button\n4. **Skeleton loaders** (optional): Replace \"Loading...\" with skeleton UI\n\n## Files to Modify\n- app/components/FilterMenu.vue\n\n## Testing\n1. Start dev server: `pnpm dev`\n2. Open filter menu\n3. Verify genres load and display with counts\n4. Verify countries load and display with counts\n5. Verify channels load and display with counts\n6. Test loading state (throttle network in DevTools)\n7. Test error state (stop server, reload page)\n8. Test retry button works\n9. Verify filtering still works correctly\n10.

The `shimmer` utility was removed from the UnoCSS config\n2. The `skeleton` shortcut still references it\n3. UnoCSS can't resolve the reference, causing the warning\n\n## Investigation Steps\n\n1. **Find the skeleton shortcut definition**:\n   ```bash\n   grep -r \"skeleton\" uno.config.ts\n   ```\n\n2. **Check if shimmer is defined anywhere**:\n   ```bash\n   grep -r \"shimmer\" uno.config.ts\n   grep -r \"shimmer\" app/\n   ```\n\n3. **Check where skeleton is used**:\n   ```bash\n   grep -r \"skeleton\" app/components/\n   ```\n\n## Expected Location\nThe issue is likely in `uno.config.ts` in the shortcuts section:\n\n```typescript\n// uno.config.ts\nexport default defineConfig({\n  shortcuts: {\n    skeleton: 'bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700 animate-pulse shimmer', // ❌ shimmer doesn't exist\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Solution Options\n\n### Option 1: Remove shimmer reference (Quick Fix)\nIf shimmer animation is not needed:\n\n```typescript\nshortcuts: {\n  skeleton: 'bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700 animate-pulse',\n}\n```\n\n### Option 2: Define shimmer animation\nIf shimmer effect is desired, add it to UnoCSS config:\n\n```typescript\n// uno.config.ts\nexport default defineConfig({\n  shortcuts: {\n    skeleton: 'bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700 animate-shimmer',\n  },\n  theme: {\n    animation: {\n      keyframes: {\n        shimmer: {\n          '0%': { backgroundPosition: '-1000px 0' },\n          '100%': { backgroundPosition: '1000px 0' },\n        },\n      },\n      durations: {\n        shimmer: '2s',\n      },\n      timingFns: {\n        shimmer: 'linear',\n      },\n      counts: {\n        shimmer: 'infinite',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Option 3: Use custom CSS for shimmer\nIf UnoCSS animation is too complex, use custom CSS:\n\n```typescript\n// uno.config.ts\nshortcuts: {\n  skeleton: 'bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700 skeleton-shimmer',\n}\n```\n\n```css\n/* Add to global CSS or component */\n.skeleton-shimmer {\n  background: linear-gradient(\n    90deg,\n    rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) 0%,\n    rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2) 50%,\n    rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) 100%\n  );\n  background-size: 200% 100%;\n  animation: shimmer 2s infinite linear;\n}\n\n@keyframes shimmer {\n  0% { background-position: -200% 0; }\n  100% { background-position: 200% 0; }\n}\n\n.dark .skeleton-shimmer {\n  background: linear-gradient(\n    90deg,\n    rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) 0%,\n    rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05) 50%,\n    rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) 100%\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Files to Check/Modify\n- `uno.config.ts` - Main UnoCSS configuration\n- `app/components/MovieCardSkeleton.vue` - Likely uses skeleton class\n- `app/components/MovieGridSkeleton.vue` - Likely uses skeleton class\n- Any other components using `class=\"skeleton\"`\n\n## Testing\n1. Fix the configuration\n2. Restart dev server: `pnpm dev`\n3. Verify warning is gone\n4. Check skeleton loading states still look good:\n   - Navigate to home page\n   - Check movie card skeletons during loading\n   - Verify animation is smooth\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] No more UnoCSS warning in console\n- [ ] Skeleton loading states still work\n- [ ] Animation is smooth (if shimmer is kept)\n- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode\n- [ ] No visual regression\n\n## Priority\n**P1 (Low)** - This is a warning, not an error. The app works fine, but it's good to clean up warnings for a cleaner development experience.\n\n## Estimated Time\n15-30 minutes\n\n## Notes\n- The warning doesn't break functionality, just clutters the console\n- If shimmer animation was intentional, we should restore it properly\n- If it was removed on purpose, just clean up the reference\n- Check git history to see when/why shimmer was removed: `git log -p --all -S 'shimmer' -- uno.config.ts`","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-27T05:10:25.180685492+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T05:14:24.677239605+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-27T05:14:24.677239605+01:00"}

Create `related_movies` table in SQLite\n2. Calculate relationships during `generate-sqlite.ts` execution\n3. Store only movie IDs (not full movie objects)\n4. Frontend queries by ID to get movie cards\n5.

{"id":"movies-deluxe-zrvd","title":"Add duration filtering for Archive.org movies with configurable minimum","description":"Currently, only YouTube videos are filtered by duration (minimum 40 minutes). Archive.org movies should also be filtered by duration during scraping to exclude short films, trailers, and clips.\n\n## Current State\n\n### YouTube Filtering (Working)\nIn `server/utils/youtube.ts`:\n```typescript\n// Filter by duration (minimum 40 minutes)\nif (duration \u003c 40 * 60) {\n  logger.info(`Skipping ${videoId}: too short (${Math.round(duration / 60)} minutes)`)\n  continue\n}\n```\n\n### Archive.org (Missing)\nIn `server/utils/archiveScraper.ts`:\n- Duration data is available in Archive.org metadata\n- No filtering is currently applied\n- Short films and clips are included in results\n\n## Problems\n1. **Inconsistent filtering**: YouTube filtered, Archive.org not filtered\n2. **Quality issues**: Short clips/trailers included in movie database\n3. **Hardcoded value**: 40-minute minimum is hardcoded in YouTube scraper\n4. **No configuration**: Can't easily adjust minimum duration\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. Add Configuration to nuxt.config.ts\n```typescript\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  runtimeConfig: {\n    // Server-side only\n    minMovieDurationMinutes: 40, // Minimum duration in minutes for movies\n  }\n})\n```\n\n### 2. Update YouTube Scraper (server/utils/youtube.ts)\nReplace hardcoded value:\n```typescript\n// Before\nif (duration \u003c 40 * 60) {\n\n// After\nconst config = useRuntimeConfig()\nconst minDuration = config.minMovieDurationMinutes * 60\nif (duration \u003c minDuration) {\n  logger.info(`Skipping ${videoId}: too short (${Math.round(duration / 60)} minutes, minimum: ${config.minMovieDurationMinutes})`)\n  continue\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add Duration Extraction to Archive.org Scraper\nIn `server/utils/archiveScraper.ts`:\n```typescript\n// Extract duration from metadata\nconst duration = item.metadata?.runtime \n  ? parseArchiveDuration(item.metadata.runtime)\n  : null\n\n// Helper function to parse Archive.org duration formats\nfunction parseArchiveDuration(runtime: string | string[]): number | null {\n  // Archive.org runtime can be:\n  // - \"1:23:45\" (HH:MM:SS)\n  // - \"83:45\" (MM:SS)\n  // - \"5400\" (seconds)\n  // - [\"1:23:45\", \"83 minutes\"] (array)\n  \n  const runtimeStr = Array.isArray(runtime) ? runtime[0] : runtime\n  if (!runtimeStr) return null\n  \n  // Try parsing as seconds\n  const seconds = parseInt(runtimeStr, 10)\n  if (!isNaN(seconds)) return seconds\n  \n  // Try parsing as HH:MM:SS or MM:SS\n  const parts = runtimeStr.split(':').map(p =\u003e parseInt(p, 10))\n  if (parts.length === 3) {\n    // HH:MM:SS\n    return parts[0] * 3600 + parts[1] * 60 + parts[2]\n  } else if (parts.length === 2) {\n    // MM:SS\n    return parts[0] * 60 + parts[1]\n  }\n  \n  return null\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Apply Duration Filter\n```typescript\nconst config = useRuntimeConfig()\nconst minDuration = config.minMovieDurationMinutes * 60\n\n// Filter by duration\nif (duration \u0026\u0026 duration \u003c minDuration) {\n  logger.info(`Skipping ${item.identifier}: too short (${Math.round(duration / 60)} minutes, minimum: ${config.minMovieDurationMinutes})`)\n  continue\n}\n\n// Warn if duration is missing\nif (!duration) {\n  logger.warn(`No duration found for ${item.identifier}, including anyway`)\n}\n```\n\n## Archive.org Duration Metadata\n\nArchive.org provides duration in the `runtime` field:\n```json\n{\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"runtime\": \"1:23:45\",  // or \"83:45\" or \"5400\"\n    \"length\": \"5025\"        // alternative field (seconds)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNeed to handle multiple formats:\n- **HH:MM:SS**: \"1:23:45\" = 5025 seconds\n- **MM:SS**: \"83:45\" = 5025 seconds  \n- **Seconds**: \"5025\" = 5025 seconds\n- **Array**: [\"1:23:45\", \"83 minutes\"] = use first element\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Add config** to `nuxt.config.ts`\n2. **Create duration parser** for Archive.org formats\n3. **Update YouTube scraper** to use config\n4. **Update Archive.org scraper** to extract and filter duration\n5. **Add logging** for filtered movies\n6. **Test** with various Archive.org movies\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `nuxt.config.ts` (add runtimeConfig)\n- `server/utils/youtube.ts` (use config instead of hardcoded value)\n- `server/utils/archiveScraper.ts` (add duration extraction and filtering)\n\n## Testing\n\n### Test Duration Parser\n```typescript\nparseArchiveDuration('1:23:45')  // 5025\nparseArchiveDuration('83:45')    // 5025\nparseArchiveDuration('5025')     // 5025\nparseArchiveDuration(['1:23:45', '83 min'])  // 5025\nparseArchiveDuration('invalid')  // null\n```\n\n### Test Filtering\n1. Run Archive.org scraper\n2. Verify short movies are skipped\n3. Check logs for duration filtering messages\n4. Verify movies \u003e= 40 minutes are included\n\n### Test Configuration\n```bash\n# Change minimum to 60 minutes\n# Edit nuxt.config.ts: minMovieDurationMinutes: 60\n# Run scraper\n# Verify 40-59 minute movies are now filtered\n```\n\n## Benefits\n- ✅ Consistent filtering across all sources\n- ✅ Better data quality (no short clips)\n- ✅ Configurable minimum duration\n- ✅ Easy to adjust for different use cases\n- ✅ Centralized configuration\n\n## Edge Cases\n- **Missing duration**: Include with warning (don't reject)\n- **Invalid format**: Include with warning\n- **Zero duration**: Reject (likely metadata error)\n- **Negative duration**: Reject (invalid data)\n\n## Configuration Options\n\nUsers can adjust minimum duration for different use cases:\n- **40 minutes** (default): Feature films only\n- **20 minutes**: Include short films\n- **60 minutes**: Strict feature films only\n- **90 minutes**: Long-form movies only\n\n## Success Criteria\n- ✅ Archive.org movies filtered by duration\n- ✅ Minimum duration configurable in nuxt.config.ts\n- ✅ YouTube scraper uses config value\n- ✅ Duration parser handles all Archive.org formats\n- ✅ Logging shows filtered movies\n- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T02:18:05.490452262+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T02:30:57.741442313+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-27T02:30:57.741442313+01:00"}
