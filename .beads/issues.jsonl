{"id":"movies-deluxe-m017","title":"Fix SQLITE_ERROR: no such column: rank when sorting by relevance","description":"When sorting by relevance in the movie grid, the app crashes with 'SQLITE_ERROR: no such column: rank'. \n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe code tries to use 'rank' column when sorting by relevance (useMovieStore.ts:707), but 'rank' only exists in FTS5 virtual tables, not in the regular 'movies' table. The lightweight query (database.worker.ts:203) queries 'movies m' directly without joining the FTS table.\n\n**Solution:**\nWhen searchQuery exists and sort is 'relevance', the lightweight query needs to:\n1. Join with fts_movies table: JOIN fts_movies f ON m.imdbId = f.imdbId\n2. Add WHERE clause: WHERE f.fts_movies MATCH ?\n3. Use rank in ORDER BY: ORDER BY rank \n4. Pass searchQuery as a parameter\n\nAlternatively, calculate relevance score in the movies table or handle FTS search separately before the lightweight query.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-02T20:57:07.454688533+01:00","updated_at":"2026-01-02T21:00:09.668657092+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-02T21:00:09.668657092+01:00"}
